Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) denounced the Trump ad as \u201cvile.\u201d\nSchumer \u2014 in by far his biggest moment as Senate minority leader \u2014 has held his caucus together so far, including red state Democrats up for reelection in 2018. Whether he can keep that going under pressure from Trump, McConnell and the entire GOP political machine is the big question, especially if the shutdown extends into next week or beyond.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this political world, in the most toxic place in that world \u2014 Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Sen.

Who made them illegal?\u201d asked Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) of McConnell. \u201cWhen he stands up and calls DACA kids illegal immigrants \u2014 they are [actually] legal.

Several of them said there had not been much dissension, and that the caucus remains united behind Schumer and the leadership. Still, lawmakers in both parties acknowledged that the real pressure won\u2019t begin until Monday, when hundreds of thousands of federal works are furloughed because of the impasse.\nDemocrats also believe that in Trump, they have a villain they can successfully tag with causing the shutdown. This is the first time that federal employees will be furloughed because of a shutdown that occurred with one party controlling the White House and Congress.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s and congressional Republican\u2019s responsibility to govern. It\u2019s their responsibility to keep the doors open and the lights on around here.

Schumer thought he had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in his talks with the president, only to have Trump later call him to shoot down a potential deal. \nSchumer said it's become an ongoing pattern with Trump, which Democrats and Republicans would both agree on, though perhaps not in public.\nThe Trump campaign web ad, which calls Democrats \"complicit\" in any murders committed by illegal immigrants, provoked an angry response.\n\"This is a shameless attempt by the president to distract from the Trump shutdown,\" said Schumer's spokesman, Matt House. \nRepublicans, also playing the branding game, have dubbed the government closure: \"#SchumerShutdown.\"\nMissing out on the latest scoops?

If even Prince, a famous teetotaler with access to the best medical care, could end up addicted to painkillers, surely that would show that the opioid epidemic was reaching every corner of America. Maybe in death, his celebrity could illuminate the high stakes of the crisis and force a reckoning.\nWe were very wrong. More than 55,000 Americans\u2014rich, poor, famous and not\u2014have since died from their own opioid overdoses. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that the death rate in 2018 could be even worse. And Friday night\u2019s news that rock star Tom Petty died from his own preventable painkiller overdose, more than a year after Prince, underscores how far there is to go.\nStory Continued Below\nIn health care, there\u2019s a quest for celebrity patients\u2014a symbol who can galvanize change. It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s worked before. Ryan White, a teenager in the 1980s, became the face of HIV/AIDS and helped drive research and reforms. More recently, actor Michael J. Fox raised awareness of Parkinson\u2019s disease; Angelina Jolie\u2019s op-ed about her breast cancer risk spurred a spike in genetic testing.\nThat hasn\u2019t really happened with painkiller deaths, perhaps because there are too many famous faces to pick from. Actors like Heath Ledger and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Musicians like Prince and Petty. And it\u2019s far from a new trend. Even Elvis Presley, who died 41 years ago, was dealing with painkiller addiction.\nA celebrity\u2019s death from painkillers also has lost its ability to shock and awe. \u201cNo one is surprised when they hear about a rock star dying of a drug overdose,\u201d said Andrew Koldony, an addiction expert at Brandeis University. \u201cIn some ways, it reinforces the stigma around addiction or that it only happens because of a certain lifestyle. Of course, that\u2019s not true at all.\u201d\nPrince and Petty, for instance, were both dealing with chronic pain\u2014like millions of everyday Americans\u2014and seemingly got hooked on drugs in their attempts to manage it. Petty\u2019s family said he played 53 separate shows while using legally prescribed medication to deal with a broken hip; his death was reportedly an accidental overdose of a mix of those legal drugs.\nThe details of Prince\u2019s death remain less clear, but investigators note that he had apparently overdosed just six days earlier, after a performance, and was administered an emergency recovery drug\u2014a worrying sign of the depth of his addiction. He also had been hiding a mix of different painkillers in aspirin bottles, with at least some of those medicines apparently prescribed to his bodyguard for privacy. Prince had suffered ankle and hip problems for years, with multiple reports that he\u2019d undergone major hip surgery\nNeither celebrity was blind to the risks. Petty had previously beaten a heroin addiction; Prince was scheduled to meet with an expert for painkiller treatment the day after he died.\n\u201cPrince was not a drug abuser\u201d in the traditional sense of celebrity rockers, Kolodny stressed. \u201cHe was a religious guy. He was a vegetarian. You couldn\u2019t smoke pot or drink alcohol on tour with him.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a deeper reason why a celebrity death hasn\u2019t arrested the opioid crisis: The problems are systemic, and too entrenched to be shaken by a few high-profile victims. About 91 people now die from opioid overdoses every day, the CDC says\u2014a conservative estimate\u2014thanks to a potent mix of stigmas, addictions, lack of awareness and inadequate access to care and prevention.\n\u201cToo many people still think it\u2019s a moral failing,\u201d said Regina LaBelle, a drug policy official in the Obama administration. \u201cToo many doctors don\u2019t screen for or recognize addiction, so we have too much untreated addiction.\u201d\nThe opioid epidemic has also made some pharmaceutical companies very rich, a real barrier to getting the industry to buy into change. Sales of prescription opioids almost quadrupled between 1999 and 2014 as the number of prescriptions soared. By 2010, there were more than eight opioid prescriptions for every 10 people. Purdue Pharma, the makers of OxyContin, have sold more than $25 billion worth of the drug in the past decade.\nMeanwhile, more than 250,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the past decade. Some projections say that could double in the decade ahead, under worst-case scenarios.\nIt\u2019s a public health crisis that largely unfolded with little attention, and perhaps that\u2019s one way that a celebrity death can help: The news of what killed Petty will trigger another round of articles about the epidemic, an issue that the media largely missed for years. While a July 2001 New York Times magazine article was the first at the Gray Lady to frame the opioid problem in terms like \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201cepidemic,\u201d it wasn\u2019t until 2014 that the Times began routinely using that shorthand.\nBeyond raising public awareness, increased media coverage has real resonance in Washington, by forcing politicians to reckon with an issue. And many congressmen also ignored opioid issues until the past few years, focusing their health care advocacy instead on political issues like the Affordable Care Act or more traditional causes like cancer. The last White House wasn\u2019t much better.\n\u201cPresident Obama neglected the epidemic,\u201d Kolodny said, noting that the Obama administration\u2019s flurry of activity\u2014which included a surge in funding for opioid-specific issues, from virtually no dollars to $1 billion\u2014didn\u2019t come until the last of Obama\u2019s eight years in office. Obama didn\u2019t even publicly address the opioid epidemic in front of a live audience until an October 2015 town hall in West Virginia. \nKolodny was among the advocates pressuring the Obama administration to do more, warning Obama that he\u2019d be remembered like Ronald Reagan for failing to acknowledge a public health crisis that unfolded on his watch. In Reagan\u2019s case, that crisis was HIV/AIDS. (And interestingly, it was a celebrity\u2014actor Rock Hudson\u2014who\u2019s credited with helping the Reagan administration make its first tentative steps toward addressing HIV/AIDS issues.)\nBut Kolodny says he\u2019s even more pessimistic about Donald Trump, who, despite making repeated proclamations about the need to solve the opioid epidemic, hasn\u2019t steered new funding to the problem and has even sought to cut resources. POLITICO reported this week on the Trump administration\u2019s plans, for the second straight year, to gut the nation\u2019s drug policy office.\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been very easy for Trump to do better than Obama on opioids,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cBut in terms of action, he\u2019s even worse.\u201d\nBeyond the Oval Office, however, there are signs of change\u2014and not because of celebrity deaths, but because of new pressures on what gets prescribed and when. The first-ever Surgeon General\u2019s report on addiction, released in 2016, devoted hundreds of pages to unpacking the crisis and issued dozens of recommendations, including how physicians could better manage patients\u2019 pain treatment. Prescriptions are down from their peak, although there are still enough opioids being prescribed that every American could be medicated around-the-clock for three weeks, the CDC says.\nThere\u2019s also been a surge of scrutiny on how the crisis unfolded. The Sackler family that owns Purdue Pharma was the target of two penetrating profiles last fall, in the New Yorker and Esquire. The company took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times last month, touting its efforts to fight the crisis and not-so-subtly seeking to shift blame elsewhere, seemingly to substance misusers.\nThere\u2019s much more to be done, and it may require average Americans to mobilize, en masse. \u201cWe need an ACT UP movement of pople in recovery,\u201d LaBelle added, citing the activist movement that helped drive reforms to treat HIV/AIDS. \u201cIt\u2019s beginning but [there\u2019s a] long way to go.\u201d\nSo, will Tom Petty\u2019s opioid overdose drive any significant change? Will it lead to that outpouring of momentum? It\u2019s far too early to say, but in the hours after the rock star toxicology report was released on Friday, a familiar drumbeat began, led by fans and family who wanted Petty\u2019s death to be as meaningful as possible, under the circumstances.\n\u201cWe recognize this report may spark a further discussion on the opioid crisis and we feel that it is a healthy and necessary discussion,\u201d said a statement from Petty\u2019s relatives, retweeted by White House opioid adviser Kellyanne Conway and many others. \u201cWe hope in some way this report can save lives.\u201d\nDan Diamond is the author of \"POLITICO Pulse,\" the must-read morning briefing on health care politics and policy.

Tom DeLay (R-Texas), Mark Foley (R-Fla.) and Duke Cunningham (R-Calif.).\nGovernment transparency advocates argue that members of the House Ethics Committee can\u2019t be counted upon to hold their colleagues accountable as well as an independent watchdog like the OCE.\n\u201cThis is alarming given the Committee\u2019s poor track record when it comes to committing to a timely, publicly accountable process,\u201d Issue One Executive Director Meredith McGehee said in a statement.\nThe OCE has the power to investigate allegations against lawmakers, but lacks the authority to dole out punishments or issue subpoenas. It can make recommendations to the Ethics Committee as to whether a case should be investigated or dismissed.\nThe Ethics Committee then decides the next steps. But reports by OCE must be publicly released after a certain amount of time has passed, unless the Ethics Committee decides to open an investigation of its own. The OCE report, however, would still have to be publicly disclosed at the end of an investigation.\nThe bipartisan overhaul of Capitol Hill\u2019s sexual harassment policies came after multiple male lawmakers were accused of sexual harassment. Female lawmakers, including an author of the legislation, Rep. Jackie SpeierKaren (Jackie) Lorraine Jacqueline SpeierThis week: Time running out for Congress to avoid shutdown Maxine Waters to skip Trump's State of the Union Dem Rep invited #MeToo founder to State of the Union MORE (D-Calif.), also shared their own stories of being sexually harassed while working on Capitol Hill.\nThe latest lawmaker to be accused of sexual harassment is Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.), after\u00a0The New York Times reported Saturday that he used taxpayer money to settle a complaint from a former staffer.\u00a0\nFollowing the New York Times report, Speaker Paul RyanPaul  Davis RyanGOP leaders pitch children's health funding in plan to avert shutdown Lawmakers see shutdown\u2019s odds rising Fix what we\u2019ve got and make Medicare right this year MORE (R-Wis.) moved to strip Meehan from his position on the House Ethics Committee and urged him to reimburse taxpayers for the settlement.\nThe harassment overhaul bill would end the practice of taxpayer-funded settlements for lawmakers accused of harassment. Any member of Congress accused of harassment who agrees to a settlement would be required to reimburse taxpayers within 90 days.\nAnother House Republican, Rep. Blake FarentholdRandolph (Blake) Blake FarentholdThis week: Time running out for Congress to avoid shutdown Woman accuses New York state senator of sexual misconduct Republicans on the run: Retirements could be trouble for Trump and party MORE (R-Texas), also acknowledged recently that he agreed to an $84,000 settlement after a former aide, Lauren Greene, accused him of sexual harassment. Farenthold has said he will take out a personal loan to repay taxpayers.\nFarenthold is now under investigation by the House Ethics Committee. But the OCE had previously reviewed Greene\u2019s claims and concluded in 2015 that there was not substantial reason to believe Farenthold sexually harassed Greene.\nAccording to a GOP aide familiar with the crafting of the legislation, Farenthold\u2019s case led to the provision concerning OCE. Greene\u2019s legal counsel had said that the OCE investigation \u201cunduly harmed\u201d Greene\u2019s case in litigation, which led the House Administration Committee to include the provision in the bill.\nSpeier called the OCE \u201ca dead letterbox for complaints.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for the House Administration Committee said that limiting investigations to the Ethics Committee would streamline the process.\n\u201cThe provision ensures that only one entity is conducting the investigation to make certain there is an accurate gathering of facts and a swift reporting of those findings,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\nBut McGehee warned that the provision bore a resemblance to the effort by House Republicans a year ago to weaken the OCE by putting it under the oversight of the House Ethics Committee. Republicans ultimately reversed course following public outcry.\n\u201cThis covert move is reminiscent of House leadership\u2019s behind-closed-doors effort to sabotage OCE at the beginning of the 115th Congress,\u201d McGehee said.\u00a0", "title": "House sexual harassment overhaul sidelines ethics watchdog", "sourceId": "the-hill", "sourceName": "The Hill", "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/house/369957-house-sexual-harassment-overhaul-sidelines-ethics-watchdog", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T23:40:18Z"}, {"textData": "New York Gov.
