[{"textData": "Tens of thousands of people have rallied against anti-corruption legislation in Romania's capital Bucharest, braving the rain and the cold as well as hostile police presence.\n\nThe protests were organised on Saturday after the leftist-leaning, ruling Social Democrats (PSD) passed a law last month, which could make it harder to prosecute crime and high-level corruption.\n\nIt still needs the approval of President Klaus Iohannis.\n\n\"I came here to live in a free country that is not full of corrupt people,\" Puica Marinescu, protester, told Al Jazeera. \"I want these assassins and mafia people who confiscated the revolution to leave the country.\"\n\nAnother protester, Alexandra, said: \"I come here because we want to correct politicians and justice in Romania.\"\n\nThe protesters briefly scuffled with riot police in Bucharest. There were smaller protests in the cities of Cluj, Timisoara, Constanta, Bacau, Sibiu and Iasi.\n\nRule of law\n\nThe European Union has spoken out and urged Romania to do more to prevent and tackle high-level corruption.\n\nRomania joined the EU in 2007 and is subject to special monitoring on the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\nMore than 90 Romanian former ministers, deputees and senators have been indicted by the Council of Europe's anti-corruption unit since 2006.\n\nBut Brussels has been accused of being too soft on the former communist state.\n\nThe scale of the protest is nothing new in Romania's history. Tens of thousands took to the streets in 1989 in a mass uprising, which led to the downfall of the communist leader Nicolae Caeuseuscu.\n\nMemories of that revolution seem rife nearly 30 years later. \"No communists, no criminals, no corrupts,\" one of the banners read in English at Saturday's demonstration.\n\nNew prime minister\n\nThe protest march followed another eventful week in Romania when Iohannis spoke out after a second failed government saw another prime minister ousted.\n\n\"After I weighed all the arguments, taking into account the actual situation in parliament, I decided to give the PSD one more chance and to designate the person they proposed, Mrs [Viorica] Dancila,\" Klaus said.\n\nDanchila will be the third prime minister in eleven months, a member of the European Parliament and the first woman to be nominated.\n\nMost controversially she is considered a very close ally to the PSD leader Liviu Dragnea. He was convicted for ballot-rigging and faces charges of abuse of office. His two-year prison sentence was suspended.\n\nIf the current anti-corruption legislation is passed, the case against him would be dropped.\n\nDanchila was brought in after her predecessor stepped down on Monday after falling out with the party head.\n\nThe new prime minster is set to be sworn in on February 2.

But today, 46 people are serving prison sentences for political activities, and another 52 political prisoners are in jail awaiting trial, the AAPP says.\n\nOTHER PRIORITIES\n\nNLD Party spokesman Aung Shin told Reuters prison reform was not yet on the legislative agenda because of other priorities.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things to do as MPs, it may be a part of the reasons for not including prison reform in the parliament discussions,\u201d Aung Shin said.\n\nHe also said, however, prisons should be part of a broader examination of legal and judicial reform that the party and legislature was planning. He did not give a time frame for any contemplated legislation.\n\nAAPP says that 120 former political prisoners from the NLD party are members of the national parliament or regional assemblies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many former political prisoners in the NLD party, and even in the current parliament,\u201d said Aung Myo Kyaw, head of AAPP\u2019s Yangon office. \u201cIt\u2019s sad they aren\u2019t considering this issue.\u201d\n\nThe military did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe home affairs ministry says it has improved prison conditions across the country. A ministry report in March said the Correctional Department had relaxed rules on family visits and improved education programs.\n\nRULE OF LAW\n\nMany of the political prisoners, including some today, were jailed in Insein, a 19th-century prison in the north of Yangon that had a notorious reputation for torture, hunger strikes and rioting over inhumane conditions until Myanmar began transitioning to civilian rule in 2011.\n\nA security officer stands guard in front of Insein Prison in Yangon, Myanmar December 29, 2017. Picture taken December 29, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nFor decades, Insein prison, which has held politicians and poets alongside murderers, thieves and drug dealers, was emblematic of oppressive junta rule and Myanmar\u2019s poor record when it came to the rule of law.\n\nSome prisoners were kept isolated or were physically and mentally abused while in jail, former inmates say. Amnesty International said misbehaving prisoners, including political prisoners on hunger strike, were still kept shackled in filth in kennels meant for dogs as recently as 2011.\n\nSuu Kyi herself was briefly held in a hut in the prison compound between spells of house arrest. Leaders of the NLD spent time there before Myanmar\u2019s military rulers started a transition to democracy in 2011 that brought both the release of hundreds of political prisoners and an improvement to prison conditions.\n\nInsein is where Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27 have been detained as they face an investigation into whether they breached Myanmar\u2019s Official Secrets Act after the two were detained on Dec. 12.\n\nBuilt during British colonial rule in the 19th century, Insein covers about 200,000 square meters - larger than New York\u2019s Grand Central station.\n\nBy some accounts, conditions there have gotten a lot better.\n\nKyaw Zwa Naing, detained in Insein for two weeks in June after writing a satirical article mocking the military, said \u201cthe prison officers treated us well\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe could access food supply without limitation. No one threatened us,\u201d he said.\n\nOVERCROWDED\n\nAfter an inspection in March, the government-backed Myanmar National Human Rights Commission identified overcrowding as a problem and recommended building new dormitories.\n\n\u201cThe unlucky ones have to sleep right next to the toilet. In Myanmar, we can\u2019t provide international standard cells for inmates,\u201d Commissioner Yu Lwin Aung told Reuters.\n\nPolitical prisoners and those accused of other non-violent offences are housed with inmates both accused and convicted of violent crimes, according to the AAPP, which regularly interviews recent inmates.\n\nFamily members say the Reuters reporters each have their own cell and sleep on mats on raised platforms. However, they say the two are fearful because they are being held in the same block as both suspected and convicted criminals.\n\nMin Tun Soe, a deputy director and spokesperson for the Prison Department said overcrowding was no longer a concern - the prison now houses 12,000 inmates after increasing its capacity to 10,000.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of reform going on in the prisons, such as new budgets for food supplies, healthcare and education opportunities for inmates, and also reforming the moral behavior of inmates,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe situation is different than it was before,\u201d he said.", "title": "While political prisoners released, Myanmar's judicial reforms stall", "sourceId": "reuters", "sourceName": "Reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists-prison/while-political-prisoners-released-myanmars-judicial-reforms-stall-idUSKBN1FA05F", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T06:47:49Z"}, {"textData": "\nAt least five civilians and four gunmen are dead following an 11-hour siege Saturday of the Intercontinental Hotel in Afghanistan's capital of Kabul, according to the country's interior ministry.\n", "title": "Kabul Intercontinental Hotel siege over, at least 5 civilians and 4 gunmen dead", "sourceId": "abc-news", "sourceName": "ABC News", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/kabul-intercontinental-hotel-siege-civilians-gunmen-dead/story?id=52486357", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T06:46:19Z"}, {"textData": "The head of North Korea's most popular female band visited South Korea on Sunday to check preparations for an art troupe\u2019s performance during next month's Winter Olympics.\n\nSinger Hyon Song Wol also leads the 140-member art troupe and crossed the heavily fortified border into Gangneung, South Korea, where the troupe is to perform during the Olympics.\n\nThe games are scheduled for Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang, but some of the events will be held in Gangneung.\n\nHyon appeared live on South Korean television, but didn\u2019t speak when she walked past a barrage of cameras and reporters before boarding an express train at Seoul's railway station, where hundreds of police officers mobilized to maintain order.\n\nHyon is leader of Pyongyang's hugely popular all-female Moranbong Band, which was handpicked by Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.\n\nShe has been the focus of intense South Korean media attention since she attended last week's talks at the border, when the two Koreas agreed on the Samjiyon art troupe's two performances \u2014 one in Seoul and the other in Gangneung.\n\nHyon and her six-member team were also scheduled to inspect two venues in the two cities for her art troupe\u2019s performance during the two-day visit starting Sunday.\n\nNorth to send athletes\n\nPhotos showed Hyon smiling and shaking heads with a South Korean official upon arrival, which came just hours after the International Olympic Committee allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the Olympics.\n\nThe athletes will include 12 women who will join South Korea's female ice-hockey team to form a unified Olympic team for the Koreas. Other sports events in which North Korean athletes will compete include figure skating, short track speed skating, Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe North Korean athletes also will march together with South Korean players under a single \"unification flag\" depicting their peninsula during the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang.\n\n\"Such an agreement would have seemed impossible only a few weeks ago,\" IOC chief Thomas Bach said in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\n'Political show'\n\nHowever, many South Koreans believe their government went too far by pushing athletes into a \"political show\" that will likely become meaningless once the lull in tensions breaks down after the Olympics.\n\nKim Hye-jin, a 39-year-old music instructor, said that South Korea was repeating an \"outdated approach\" in using sports diplomacy. She said that the previous unified teams and joint marches between the rivals never paved the way for sustained, meaningful engagement.\n\n\"We are always repeating meaningless things and North Korea isn't a country that will change easily,\" she said.\n\nPlus, she said, a unified team takes away opportunities from South Korean athletes who have been working hard to prepare for the Olympics.\n\nHeo Doo-won, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, didn't care for the reconciliatory gestures at all.\n\n\"Why are we doing this?\" he asked. \"We are clearly two different countries and it's better if things stay that way. I don't want a unified team or a unification flag. Why can't we just let the North Koreans march under their own flag?\"\n\nSouth's president dips in polls\n\nWhile South Korea's liberal president, Moon Jae-in, remains popular nine months into his term, the controversy over the hockey team factored in his approval rating dipping below 70 percent for the first time in four months, according to a Gallup Korea report on Friday.\n\nBut the inter-Korean effort to reconcile sparked after Kim expressed his willingness to improve ties and send a delegation to the Olympics in a New Year's speech. Hyon\u2019s delegation was expected in South Korea on Saturday, but North Korea abruptly canceled the plan on Friday night before it proposed the two-day trip. It wasn't clear why the visit was rescheduled.\n\nThe Samjiyon art troupe, which comprises orchestra members, singers and dancers, is part of North Korea's Olympic delegation that also includes athletes, officials, journalists and a taekwondo demonstration team. As a sign of warming ties, Samjiyon's performances would be the first by a North Korean group in South Korea since 2002.\n\nHyon was a popular singer before she was appointed to lead the Moranbong Band, which serves as the \"soft\" public face of the Kim government. Its members in short skirts and high heels or stylish military uniforms sing and dance odes to Kim. There\u2019s speculation that some of the Moranbong members may also appear in the Samjiyon art troupe.\n\nSouth Korea hopes to use the Olympics to ameliorate relations with its rival after a year of tension over North Korea's rapidly expanding nuclear and missiles program.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "title": "North Korean pop star tours Olympic venues in South - Fox News", "sourceId": "fox-news", "sourceName": "Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2018/01/20/north-korean-pop-star-tours-olympic-venues-in-south.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T06:45:56Z"}, {"textData": "MUSCAT (Reuters) - Global oil suppliers will consider whether to extend their cooperation beyond 2018, but such cooperation would not necessarily mean extending current output levels, Saudi Arabian energy minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t limit our efforts to 2018 - we need to be talking about a longer framework of cooperation,\u201d Falih told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the joint ministerial committee which oversees implementation of the global deal on supply cuts.", "title": "Saudi energy minister: may extend oil suppliers' cooperation beyond 2018", "sourceId": "reuters", "sourceName": "Reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-saudi/saudi-energy-minister-may-extend-oil-suppliers-cooperation-beyond-2018-idUSKBN1FA05B", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T06:38:05Z"}, {"textData": "Even without Alec Baldwin's President Trump, \"Saturday Night Live\" still found a way to mock the commander in chief.\n\nThe NBC variety show opened its episode Saturday night with Aidy Bryant's White House press secretary Sarah Sanders greeting the press corps by first mentioning Saturday's Women's March.\n\n\"A million women strong out there to celebrate the President's first kick-ass year in office,\" Bryant's Sanders said. \"We did it, girls!\"\n\nBryant's press secretary then brought on White House doctor Ronny Jackson, who was played by Beck Bennett, to give the results of Trump's latest physical exam.\n\n\"This is the President's unbiased, 100% accurate health assessment.

The public, Eric Trump said, would blame Democrats for the paralysis in Washington, and for the forced furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal employees, who would be sent home without pay.\n\nYet even if this prediction came true \u2013 and recent polling suggests otherwise \u2013 it could be seen as a stumble at a politically fraught time for his father and Republican lawmakers.\n\nTo be sure, Eric Trump is not the sort of experienced politician who might be expected to navigate situations like these with traditional savvy. But neither is he the disinterested outsider that he promised to be in late 2016, as his father prepared to take office.\n\nIn March 2017, weeks after the elder Trump's inauguration, Eric Trump was still describing a \"clear separation of church and state\" between his father's political career and the Trump Organization, the family real estate business that he and his brother Donald Trump Jr. are managing while their father is president. Yet almost from the start, both Eric and Donald Jr. have served as outspoken political advocates for the president and his policies.\n\nSaturday offered a perfect example of this ongoing tension. By calling in to Jeanine Pirro's show a little after 9 p.m. ET, Eric Trump was serving as a both a de facto White House surrogate on prime-time TV and as a stand-in for his father at a gala fundraiser for Trump's reelection campaign.\n\nWhether Eric Trump's boast will turn into a headache for the Trump White House remains to be seen. And it wasn't the only miscalculation he made on Saturday night.\n\nDuring Saturday's call-in with Pirro, Eric Trump sought to explain why Democrats deserve the blame for the current shutdown by highlighting how many Democrats voted against a bill to fund the government.\n\n\"If you looked at the vote, you had 269 Republicans who voted to keep the government open. And you had 230 Democrats who voted to close government,\" he said, \"and they'll say Trump wanted to close the government. ... It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

When a guard informed said he could only enter using the main entrance, he decided to make his way home.\n\nHowever, a gang of five CasaPound supporters was waiting at his car.\n\nRecognising one of the young men as a former classmate, Gianelli asked what they were doing at his car.\n\n\"Then he hit me, and I fell,\" he says.\n\nWithin seconds of hitting the pavement, kicks and punches thudded against Gianelli's sides as he put his hands up to protect his head.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nHis attackers left him on the ground with his lips busted, a mouth full of blood and three broken ribs.\n\n\"Go tell the police now,\" they said, mocking him.\n\nBorn as a political movement in 2003, when far-rightists occupied a vacant municipal building in central Rome, CasaPound's name is an ode to the American poet Ezra Pound, who was a supporter of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini.\n\n'A controlled form of neo-fascism'\n\nIn November, CasaPound clenched around 6,000 votes of the vote in Ostia's municipal elections - a nearly 600 percent increase from the previous vote a few years earlier.\n\nIts newfound success in Ostia came on the heels of the party securing eight percent of the votes in Lucca's mayoral elections in June and recently landing its members on city councils in nearby Todi and the northern city of Bolzano.\n\nWith CasaPound's Luca Marsella, a vocal fascist who has been accused of violent threats, now a district councilor in Ostia, the elections have prompted fear among political opponents and analysts who worry about the return of fascism in a country that toiled for 21 years under Mussolini's rule.\n\nGuido Caldiron, a Rome-based journalist and author of Extreme Right, a book that examines the growth of the far right in Europe and elsewhere, says the electoral results in Ostia are \"very important because Rome is CasaPound's core. For them, it's a very significant victory\".\n\nDescribing a \"militarised entity\" whose supporters simultaneously carry out attacks while the party's brass denies any affiliation with bloodshed, Caldiron tells Al Jazeera: \"Even when they are involved in violence, they always try to cover it.\"\n\nThe efforts at protecting its brand and presenting a respectable face to the public, Caldiron argues, distinguishes CasaPound from other far-right groups that openly celebrate violence against anti-fascists and migrants.\n\n\"They have people who are legitimate criminals, and they have to control that - it's a controlled form of neo-fascism,\" he explains.\n\n\"You can be violent, but you have to accept certain rules and not show off about your violence \u2026 It is all part of a package designed to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of respectability.\"\n\nDeadly and dangerous attacks\n\nDespite regularly denying violence, CasaPound's members and supporters have a lengthy history of attacks.\n\nIn December 2011, a 50-year-old CasaPound supporter in Florence shot dead two Senegalese street traders and injured three others before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide.\n\nCasaPound activist Alberto Palladino has been sentenced to two years in prison over an attack that hospitalised five activists from the centre-left Democratic Party that same year. The party claims that he was wrongfully convicted.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nMore recently, as locals in Ostia geared up to cast their ballots in November, local mob affiliate Roberto Spada head-butted and struck with a pipe reporter Daniele Piervincenzi when the journalist asked about his support for CasaPound.\n\nSpada had previously proclaimed in a Facebook post.\n\nThe incident was caught on tape and led to national outcry.\n\nCasaPound subsequently attempted to distance itself from the Spada Clan, a local mafia network active in Ostia.\n\n'If there were no anti-fascists, there'd be no violence'\n\nOn a chilly morning in early January, a self-described \"militant\" opens the door of CasaPound's squat in central Rome. Inside, he points to the walls of the corridor, which are colourfully painted with the names of the party's heroes.\n\nMussolini and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whose work was glorified by both Italian and German fascists, are honoured.\n\nLess explicable are names such as Ahmad Shah Massoud, the late Afghan militia leader who battled the Soviets and the Taliban alike, and Jack Kerouac, the American novelist and pioneer of the Beat Generation literary movement.\n\nSimone Di Stefano, CasaPound's prime ministerial candidate in the upcoming national elections in March, insists that the party's gains in Ostia are important in an area \"that has been abandoned by the state\" that has been unfairly branded as a \"mafia city\".\n\nSwaddled in a black winter coat, Di Stefano runs his hand through his short, grey-peppered hair. He sits in a conference room.\n\nThe walls are blanketed in party propaganda announcing conferences and celebrating visits by far-right parties from across the Europe.\n\nOne of the posters announces a 2014 meeting between CasaPound and party officials from the Golden Dawn, the neo-fascist party in nearby Greece.\n\nOn an adjacent wall, a framed CasaPound poster brandishes the face of Julius Evola, the Italian philosopher whose work sought to advance fascism.\n\nSince its establishment 14 years ago, CasaPound has opened 106 offices across the country and boasts of 20,000 card-carrying members.\n\nIn recent years, the party broadened its base with increasing success by taking aim at refugees and migrants, capitalising on Euroscepticism and squatting buildings to protest Italy's housing crisis.\n\nWhile leftists and anarchists have for decades occupied buildings for people displaced by evictions and carried out social projects such as distributing food to the poor, CasaPound's cooptation of these tactics come with an important distinction: Italians only.\n\nDi Stefano does not deny its supporters participate in physical confrontation.\n\n\"If there were no anti-fascists, there would be no violence,\" he says.\n\nHe points to an incident in January 2017, when a police officer was injured while attempting to defuse an explosive device outside a CasaPound-linked bookshop in Florence.\n\nReferring to Gianelli, the anti-fascist who claims to have been attacked, he says the accusations are \"lies\", adding that CasaPound has attempted to sue the activist for libel in the past.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nDi Stefano blames the media and anti-fascists for violence, dubbing them as agents of \"globalism\", a term that critics say carries anti-Semitic undertones.\n\n\"There is no actual evidence [of CasaPound] doing physical attacks,\" he claims.\n\nA priest and teenager resolve to fight on\n\nBack in Ostia, local leaders and residents dismiss claims of CasaPound's innocence.\n\nWitnessing the party's rise around him, Franco De Donno, a priest who has lived in the suburb since 1981, decided last Autumn to run in the municipal elections. Now a district councilor, he sits across the table from the fascist party's Marsella in municipal meetings.\n\nExplaining that he was born on June 2, 1946, the day that Italy became a republic, De Donno says: \"Being democratic and anti-fascist is in my DNA.\"\n\nSitting in a cafe on Ostia's main square, De Donno recounts leaving the church after a sermon to find a band of CasaPound members holding up a banner accusing him of being a traitor for his open support of refugees and migrants.\n\nThe priest has helped form a network of solidarity activists and like-minded members of the faith community.\n\n\"If this mentality of exclusion [of migrants and others] continues, there will be no peace and no development,\" he argues, \"but the strongest enemy that needs to be defeated is indifference [to fascism].\"\n\nCarlo*, a 16-year-old Ostia local, smokes a cigarette and drinks espresso at a cafe.\n\nYoung people, he says, should get involved in the anti-fascist movement early on.\n\nHe has been twice assaulted by CasaPound supporters.\n\nDuring the summer of 2017, a CasaPound supporter - an adult male - asked if he had been present in anti-fascist demonstrations in front of the party's offices.\n\n\"What?\" he replied, surprised by the question.\n\nThen a fist crashed into his eye. \"What the f*ck? I didn't do anything,\" Carlo said.\n\nHe decided not to press charges because he did not trust the police department.\n\n\"Then other people started threatening me,\" he explains. \"They said, 'We'll shoot you.'\"\n\nFrom that day on, when CasaPound supporters saw him in the street, they hurled insults and threats in his direction. \"They called me a 'shitty hippie' and a 'communist f*ggot.'.\"\n\nA few months later, when Carlo and his girlfriend were at a pub, a group of seven CasaPound supporters - all adults - called him over to their table. \"What do you think about fascism?\" one of them men asked him.\n\nFearing another attack, Carlo replied simply: \"It's an important part of our country's history.\"\n\nHe remembers: \"I wanted to say, 'Fascism is sh*tty,' but I couldn't.\"\n\nAfter a brief exchange, the man grabbed Carlo by the collar, pulled him close and threatened him. When Carlo broke free, a fist was thrown in his direction and narrowly missed his face.\n\nOne of the men yelled at him and his girlfriend: \"You deserve to have c*cks on your face.\"\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nWorried by the prospect of more violence, Carlo has changed his daily routine, avoiding CasaPound's office and hangouts frequented by the party's supporters.\n\nBut he insists that he will continue to protest.\n\n\"I'm not scared.

That number is now 35.\n\nHowever, the remaining nine are among the biggest and most lucrative in the world: Football, golf and cricket among them.\n\nSerena Williams is the only female in the world's 100 highest-paid athletes.

Golf executives believe the women's game has struggled to attract an even share because their tournaments are often billed as space-fillers in the broadcasting schedules between men's tournaments.\n\nLichtenhein believes one of the key ways to increase the amount of money available to female athletes is to reach out to different TV channels and online streaming platforms not traditionally associated with sport.\n\n\"We're seeing some progress.

Strikingly, the public divides evenly on whether or not he\u2019s mentally stable.\n\n\nThat question aside, a lopsided majority, 73 percent of those polled, rejects Trump\u2019s self-assessed genius. Seventy percent say he fails to acquit himself in a way that\u2019s fitting and proper for a president. Two-thirds say he\u2019s harming his presidency with his use of Twitter. And 52 percent see him as biased against blacks -- soaring to 79 percent of blacks themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee PDF for full results, charts and tables.\n\n\nJust 36 percent of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, while 58 percent disapprove, essentially unchanged since midsummer. Next lowest at one year was Gerald Ford\u2019s 45 percent in 1975; average pre-Trump approval -- since Harry Truman\u2019s presidency -- is 63 percent.\n\n\nWomen are especially critical of Trump in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates: A mere 29 percent approve of his work, vs. 44 percent of men. And a remarkable 55 percent of women doubt Trump\u2019s mental stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s signature achievement, the new tax law, is unpopular; 60 percent say it favors the wealthy (even most well-off Americans say so), and the public by a 12-point margin, 46 to 34 percent, says it\u2019s a bad thing for the country. At the same time, a majority celebrates his most prominent failure, on Obamacare; 57 percent say the program\u2019s continuation is a good thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA vast 87 percent support the DACA immigration program that Trump ended and whose fate in Congress is uncertain -- including two-thirds of strong conservatives, three-quarters of evangelical white Protestants and as many Republicans, core Trump groups. And 63 percent overall oppose a U.S.-Mexico border wall, essentially unchanged since before the 2016 election.\n\n\nAs reported Friday, Trump -- and his party leaders -- also are at greater risk in the government shutdown, with Americans 20 points more likely to say they\u2019d blame Trump and the Republicans in Congress than the Democrats in Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a controversy that continues to cloud his presidency, half of Americans think members of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia to try to influence the election. About as many, 49 percent, think Trump himself obstructed justice in the Russia investigation.\n\n\nThat said, far fewer, 26 percent, think there\u2019s been \u201csolid evidence\u201d of obstruction; the rest call it their suspicion only. And approval of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s handling of the investigation has ebbed, from 58 to 50 percent in 11 weeks.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s ratings might be yet worse were it not for sharply improved economic sentiment. Fifty-eight percent say the economy is in good (or even excellent) shape, the most in 17 years. But just 38 percent say the Trump administration deserves credit; many more, 50 percent, credit the Obama administration. It\u2019s axiomatic that a successful economy doesn\u2019t guarantee presidential popularity, it merely makes it possible -- and Trump\u2019s other challenges tie his shoelaces.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s criticism for the Democrats, as well, in their response to Trump\u2019s unpopularity, but it\u2019s eased to some extent. In November, 61 percent of Americans said the Democratic Party\u2019s leaders were criticizing Trump without presenting alternatives; that\u2019s down to 53 percent. However, just 31 percent say the Democrats are offering alternatives, essentially unchanged from 28 percent last fall. Instead, more now are simply unsure.\n\n\nIt\u2019s true, too, that some Trump initiatives, while not popular, are not broadly opposed. Three divide the country about evenly: the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants (46 percent say it\u2019s a good thing for the country, 47 percent a bad thing); reduced business regulations (44-42 percent); and a reduction in the federal workforce (44-43 percent).\n\n\nAmong other results, 60 percent say Trump\u2019s accomplished not much or nothing in his first year; Bill Clinton did as badly on that score, but still ended 1993 with an approval rating that\u2019s 22 points higher than Trump\u2019s today. Most, in another result, say Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t affected their own families, but more say they\u2019ve been hurt (26 percent) than helped (20 percent).\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s gone from 11 points underwater in job approval last spring to 22 points today, a shift that occurred by July and has stabilized since. That\u2019s a vast swing from his 12 predecessors, who averaged 29 points to the positive after a year in the White House.\n\n\nFour previous presidents -- Barack Obama, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Truman \u2013 were at 51 to 53 percent approval after one year; Bill Clinton saw 56 percent and the rest ranged from 63 percent (Richard Nixon) to 83 percent (George W. Bush, after 9/11). Ratings at one year don\u2019t predict a career trajectory. That said, a score in the 30s, this early in a presidency, is uncharted territory.\n\n\nIndeed just six of the past 12 presidents ever went as low or lower in approval as Trump is now -- Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Nixon, Carter and both Bushes -- and all but Truman, much later in their presidencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cstrong\u201d disapprovers, moreover, outnumber his strong approvers by a 2-1 margin. Obama got there as well, but it took him more than two-and-a-half years in office, and a deeply struggling economy.\n\n\nCompared with the first ABC News/Washington Post poll of his presidency, in April, Trump is less popular generally across the board, but especially among college graduates (-11 points, to 31 percent approval), residents of the Northeast and West regions (-9 and -8 points, respectively) and whites -8 points, vs. no change among nonwhites, who started so low).\n\n\n\n\nThere are impressive differences among groups above and beyond the wide gender gap in Trump\u2019s approval. He\u2019s at new lows, 6 and 7 percent approval, respectively, among Democrats and liberals, compared with 80 percent of strong conservatives, 78 percent of Republicans and 68 percent of evangelical white Protestants. (He slips to 59 percent approval among \u201csomewhat\u201d conservatives.)\n\n\nSuch gaps have become a fixture of the sharply divided political firmament. Obama, for example, saw a low of 7 percent approval for Republicans, at the same time (March 2015) that he was at 79 percent among Democrats.\n\n\nPartisan predispositions influence more than job approval. Consider:\n\n\n-- Seventy-nine percent of Democrats think Trump obstructed the Russia investigation, and 51 percent of independents agree \u2013 diving to just 13 percent of Republicans.\n\n\n-- Seventy-five percent of Democrats think Trump is not mentally stable. Forty-six percent of independents share that view. Just 14 percent of Republicans agree. (Party and ideology aside, Trump is most likely to be seen as stable by white evangelicals, 79 percent, and non-college-educated white men, 69 percent; and most likely to be seen as not stable by nonwhites, including two-thirds of blacks and Hispanics alike.)\n\n\n-- Fifty percent of Republicans say Trump\u2019s a genius. That plummets in other groups -- 17 percent of independents, 6 percent of Democrats. There\u2019s also a notable division within conservative ranks on the question. Among people who are strongly conservative, 52 percent call Trump a genius, while among \u201csomewhat\u201d conservatives, this drops to just 29 percent.\n\n\n\n\nThere are notable differences among groups on substantive issues as well. Fifty-eight percent of whites call the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants a good thing for the country; just 26 percent of nonwhites -- including 18 percent of Hispanics -- agree. Or, looking at two key voting groups in 2016, 74 percent of non-college-educated white men say it\u2019s a good thing, compared with 39 percent of college-educated white women.\n\n\nThen there\u2019s the tax bill. Among Americans on the lower half of the income scale, 26 percent call it a good thing for the country, compared with 41 percent of those with middle incomes or more. Even in those middle and higher ranges, though, there\u2019s only a division on whether the bill is a good thing or bad thing -- 41-43 percent in the $50,000 to $100,000 bracket, and about the same, 40-43 percent, in the $100,000-plus range (about two in 10 adults).\n\n\nOne last finding cuts to a telling example of general agreement, rather than disagreement, and again not to Trump\u2019s advantage. Among lower-income Americans, 64 percent say the tax bill favors the wealthy. And among the comparatively wealthy themselves, those with $100,000-plus incomes, 56 percent say the same thing.\n\n\n\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Jan. 15-18, 2018, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults.

The shelter has yet to be used, and Stefan Pan for one wants to keep it that way.\n\n\u201cThe Brenner Pass is Europe\u2019s main north-south artery,\u201d said Pan, vice president of the main Italian business association, Confindustria. \u201cBlock the border, and it could cause a heart attack.\u201d\n\nTrucks and freight trains travel through the Brenner pass on the border of Italy and Austria. Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nThe crossing symbolizes Europe\u2019s past and present, though the question troubling Pan is what it will mean for the future.\n\nItalian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler cemented their partnership in World War II here. As the European Union helped foster postwar peace, customs and immigration checks melted away. Now the busiest pass through the Alps encapsulates what\u2019s shaping up as the continent\u2019s defining challenge in 2018: Should governments respond to the frustrations that boosted populists in elections last year with more EU integration, or less?\n\nEconomies are growing again, the flow of refugees has abated, yet a nationalist undercurrent still threatens to submerge the Franco-German vision for the European project.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has taken the lead in pressing to recapture the political initiative and strengthen the EU so it can start solving the problems that have prompted voters to turn to extremists. Key areas he has identified for deepened integration include intelligence sharing and defense, control of the bloc\u2019s outer borders, and a budget for the euro area.\n\nGermany may be getting on board. A preliminary coalition deal reached between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Party and the center-left Social Democrats puts \u201cA New Start for Europe\u201d at the top of its list of priorities.\n\nLast week, Mario Centeno, the new group head for the euro region\u2019s finance ministers, said that the coming months offer a \u201cunique window of opportunity\u201d to strengthen the common currency. He called for agreement by the EU\u2019s June summit to unify banking and capital markets regulation, and to increase fiscal burden sharing.\n\nNational electoral commissions\n\nBut persuading the EU\u2019s 28 nations to agree on game-changing projects is likely to be tough, even with the perennially awkward British heading for the exit door.\n\nEuroskeptic nationalist politicians now run Hungary and Poland. In March, Italy is expected to hold elections that could produce a less pro-European government in Rome. Meanwhile, the far-right Freedom Party of Austria recently joined a coalition government in Vienna. Its party members or affiliates head the foreign, interior and defense ministries.\n\nLast week alone, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung he was \u201cmuch more skeptical\u201d about creating a common budget for the euro area, while Interior Minister Herbert Kickl said infrastructure was needed to \u201cconcentrate\u201d asylum seekers. In an interview published on Friday, he also announced the creation of a \u201cstandby force\u201d ready to man check points on Austria's frontiers within hours of getting the order.\n\nJust how awkward the divisions can be was on display at the last EU summit, in December. A two-hour debate on immigration went so badly that EU President Donald Tusk said it was proving \u201chard to even find common language.\u201d He too gave leaders until June to come to an agreement.\n\nEven the Netherlands\u2019 center-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte has warned that Europe\u2019s project of \u201cever closer union\u201d is a threat, rather than a solution for liberal democracy.\n\n\u201cNo more institutions or even further integration,\u201d Rutte told the European Parliament\u2019s grouping of liberal parties in December. \u201cLook and you will see that the people of Europe are screaming to us through the ballot boxes. They are not wrong. You are wrong.\u201d\n\nSoldiers patrol the streets near the Brenner Pass outlet mall in Brennero. Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nIn Brennero, the village on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass, Pan and others from the German-speaking South Tyrol region, are disturbed by the prospect of an EU that becomes fractured by a return of 20th century nationalism or stops integrating further.\n\nImmigration is at the heart of it. As more than 1 million refugees from Syria, North Africa and elsewhere landed by sea in Greece and Italy in 2015 and 2016, many made their way north to Germany through the Brenner Pass. Austria\u2019s defense minister at one point said he had readied tanks and troops to block the pass if need be.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the economic hit. Last year, about 2.2 million trucks barreled through the mountain crossing. Steady streams of freight and passenger trains run on tracks either side of the highway, carrying goods and people north and south.\n\nBertelsmann Stiftung, January 2018 EUpinions report.\n\nPan\u2019s own Italian company is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of strudel, baking 35 kilometers (22 miles) of the tubular German pastry every day. Most of his consumers aren\u2019t in Italy, but to the north.\n\n\u201cLook at German cars. A year\u2019s production uses 4 billion euros worth of components from Italian manufacturers,\u201d he said, describing the Brenner Pass as part of a Europe-wide assembly line. \u201cMacron\u2019s plan is the way we have to go.\u201d\n\nOf course, the European economy managed healthy growth for decades before the visa-free Schengen area began in 1995, despite internal border checks. But going back would be harder.\n\nIf border guards were put to work under the canopy over the Brenner Pass, \u201cwe\u2019d have 15 to 20 kilometer tailbacks,\u201d said Peter Mock, commissar of the highway police based in Sterzing, a small medieval town 11 miles into the Italian part of Tyrol. The number of trucks crossing the pass has increased by at least eight or nine times since 1995, he said.\n\nFritz Karl Messner Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nThere\u2019s a political worry, too. South Tyrol is a land of schnitzel and beer, more than pasta and wine. It was part of Austria until 1919, when Italy annexed it. Only the negotiation of substantial autonomy from Rome and an increasingly lax border with Austria enabled nationalist passions to subside.\n\nThe flow of refugees coming to Europe has fallen dramatically since last year. Still, soldiers wearing the distinctive raven-feathered caps of Italy\u2019s Alpini brigades patrol the short streets around the Brenner Pass outlet mall. It\u2019s the same regiment that accompanied Mussolini to his meeting with Hitler, in 1940.\n\nFritz Karl Messner, the mayor of Sterzing -- Vipiteno in Italian -- said that for now locals in the little snow-covered ski resort are coping fine with the handful of asylum seekers who have settled here to work. On a recent visit, two African migrants were handing out fliers at either end of the town\u2019s medieval high street.\n\nSpeaking at his offices in the regional capital Bolzano -- Bozen in German -- Governor Arno Kompatscher described the two parts of today\u2019s Tyrol, Austrian and Italian, as a model for the kind of integration the EU needs more of.\n\nSupport for rejoining Austria is marginal, but hardened borders and resurgent nationalism could change that, he said: \u201cThis is a little Europe within Europe.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by John Follain, and Jonathan Tirone", "title": "Now Comes the Fight Over Europe\u2019s Future", "sourceId": "bloomberg", "sourceName": "Bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-21/now-comes-the-fight-over-europe-s-future", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T05:01:09Z"}, {"textData": "In a fiery speech at a MoveOn rally outside the Capitol on Friday evening, Gutierrez accused President Donald Trump of exposing himself as a racist with his \u201cshithole\u201d countries remarks.

The joint march and the unified hockey team were approved Saturday by the International Olympic Committee, which allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the games in exceptional entries given to the North.\n\nNot all South Koreans are in the mood. There are apparently few objections to the North Korean presence at the Olympics itself, which likely ensures that the country holds off any significant weapons test or other aggressive acts that would risk disrupting the games.\n\nMany South Koreans believe their government went too far by pushing athletes into a \"political show\" that will likely become meaningless once the lull in tensions breaks down after the Olympics.\n\nKim Hye-jin, a 39-year-old music instructor, said that South Korea was repeating an \"outdated approach\" in using sports diplomacy. She said that the previous unified teams and joint marches between the rivals never paved the way for sustained, meaningful engagement.\n\n\"We are always repeating meaningless things and North Korea isn't a country that will change easily,\" she said.\n\nPlus, she said, a unified team takes away opportunities from South Korean athletes who have been working hard to prepare for the Olympics.\n\nHeo Doo-won, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, didn't care for the reconciliatory gestures at all.\n\n\"Why are we doing this?\" he asked. \"We are clearly two different countries and it's better if things stay that way. I don't want a unified team or a unification flag. Why can't we just let the North Koreans march under their own flag?\"\n\nWhile the liberal Moon remains a popular president nine months into his term, the controversy over the hockey team factored in his approval rating dipping below 70 percent for the first time in four months, according to a Gallup Korea report on Friday.\n\nMany people sympathize with the South Korean athletes who would likely be sacrificing opportunities for the North's players, who are considered less skilled and experienced. The IOC approved an expanded roster of 35 instead of 22 for the joint team, but only the normal number will be allowed to suit up for each game and three of them must be North Korean.\n\nThe South Korean team's Canadian coach, Sarah Murray, has expressed concerns over chemistry.\n\n\"Adding somebody so close to the Olympics is a little bit dangerous just for team chemistry because the girls have been together for so long,\" she said last week.\n\nChoi Hyuk, a 40-year-old office worker, blamed the government for failing to properly communicate with the players and for excessively politicizing sports.\n\nChoi pointed to the comments of Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, who was forced to apologize after saying that the South Korean women's hockey team was out of \"medal range\" anyway while defending the government's decision to create the unified team.\n\n\"South Korea's elite sports have always been based on nationalism,\" Choi said, referring to a decades-long system that rewards Olympic medal winners with lifelong cash payments and exemption from military duties that are mandatory for most able-bodied men.\n\n\"Isn't it funny that the same country is now asking athletes to cut back on their playing time and embrace changes that would make them less likely to win?\"\n\nThe reconciliation mood between the Koreas began after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year's speech that he was willing to send a delegation to the Olympics.\n\nSome experts view Kim's overture as an attempt to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and buy time to further advance his nuclear weapons program. Last year, North Korea carried out its sixth and biggest nuclear test and test-fired three intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has shown no willingness to give up its ambitions.\n\nStill, many experts think Moon's government made the right move in jumping at the opportunity to resume contact with North Korea after nearly two years of diplomatic stalemate and animosity.\n\nIn an annual policy report on Friday, South Korea's Unification Ministry said it aims to use the Olympics as an opportunity to re-establish regular dialogue with North Korea. The resumption of inter-Korean talks is crucial for the policies of Moon, who wants Seoul in the driver's seat in international efforts to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat.\n\nThe Koreas sent joint teams to major international sporting events twice in 1991, and had their athletes march together in the opening and closing ceremonies of several sporting events in the 2000s, including the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile the previous moves had little diplomatic impact, similar gestures would carry more meaning in an Olympics held on South Korean soil and amid higher stakes in regional security, said Yongchul Chung, a sports education professor at Seoul's Sogang University.\n\n\"Fielding a unified team is very meaningful \u2014 the biggest fruit that can come from the Pyeongchang Olympics is a message of peace between the Koreas,\" Chung said. \"It's not like the players wouldn't understand the historic significance of what they are involved in.\"\n\nBut it has become harder to get South Koreans excited for unified teams and joint marches when North Korea's increasingly aggressive weapons tests and the South's own evolvement as an economy and society continue to erode the public's enthusiasm for reunification.\n\nIn a survey of 1,200 adults released by Seoul National University in October, 53.8 percent of the respondents said they supported the idea of reunification. This represented a steep drop from the 63.8 percent measured in 2007, when the school started the annual survey.\n\n\"I think it will be emotionally moving to watch the athletes of both Koreas march under the same flag during the opening ceremony as we come from the same nation,\" said Oh Ju-yeon, a 46-year-old housewife. \"But after the games, there will be bitterness from realizing that nothing's really going to change.\"", "title": "Not all South Koreans are happy about unified hockey team", "sourceId": "abc-news", "sourceName": "ABC News", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-koreans-happy-unified-hockey-team-52495628", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T03:55:36Z"}, {"textData": "\nA former assistant police chief for a Kentucky police department allegedly instructed a police recruit to shoot black minors if he were to catch them smoking marijuana, according to court documents.\n\n\nIn an Aug. 31 letter to Prospect, Kentucky Mayor John Evans, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell wrote that he has \"serious concerns\" about the then-assistant police chief Todd Shaw, who at the time was acting chief for the city of Prospect, a suburban city in the Louisville metropolitan area.\n\n\nWhen senior Jefferson County prosecutors met with members of the Louisville Metro Police Department, they reviewed \"highly disturbing racist and threatening Facebook private messages\" Shaw exchanged with a former LMPD police recruit, the letter states. The prosecutors were there to conduct an investigation to determine whether to file criminal against Shaw, O'Connell said.\n\n\nThe prosecutors found the messages while investigating a case in which Shaw allegedly tried to assist another officer by improperly accessing the National Crime Information Center database, his attorney in the criminal case, Nick Mudd, told ABC News. Prosecutors have dropped efforts file criminal charges against Shaw in that case, Mudd said, adding that he \"did nothing wrong.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Facebook messages of concern, which accompanied the letter O'Connell sent to Evans, occurred from September to October 2016, O'Connell said.\n\n\nIn the Facebook messages, Shaw and the recruit discussed a scenario for the recruit's training in which he had to write a paper on the \"right thing to do\" if he were to come across three juveniles who were smoking marijuana, O'Connell wrote. The recruit appears to have come to Shaw for advice, telling him, \"I'm so confused about this paper,\" in the message, dated Oct. 5, 2016.\n\n\n\"F--- the right thing,\" Shaw allegedly wrote. \"If black shoot them.\"\n\n\nShaw allegedly made other \"racially threatening statements,\" which included instructions on \"how to handle the juveniles' parents,\" according to the letter.\n\n\n\"...if mom is hot then f--- her,\" Shaw allegedly wrote. \"...if dad is hot then handcuff him and make him s--- my d---.\"\n\n\nShaw allegedly continued, \"Unless daddy is black...Then shoot him...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another alleged message, dated Sept. 24, 2016, the recruit told Shaw that he didn't think he will be the class leader in his recruit class because a former corrections officer was in the class. Shaw then allegedly told that recruit that he was required to sign a form saying he \"wasn't racist or associated with racists or associated with racist or hate groups per some KY law.\"\n\n\n\"What has POLICING come to when all you can shoot are white people and injured deer,\" Shaw allegedly wrote. \"Lol.\"\n\n\n\"As Jefferson County Attorney, I feel compelled to notify and warn you of Shaw's deeply offensive and racist statements,\" O'Connell wrote to the mayor. \"There is no place in police departments for men or women who hold such strongly held prejudices, including recommending shooting people simply because of their race.\"\n\n\nO'Connell stressed how \"disturbing\" it was that a senior law enforcement officer with more than 20 years of experience was expressing racist views to a \"young recruit.\"\n\n\nThe letter to the mayor included attachments of the relevant Facebook messages and copied in other relevant officials, including the Prospect Police Chief and the Louisville Metro Police Chief.\n\n\nIn another alleged message on April 8, 2017, Shaw allegedly referred to Martin Luther King Jr. as \"nothing but a [racist] womanizer.\"\n\n\n\"But because someone shot him, I get a day off with pay each year so I will take it,\" the message allegedly stated.\n\n\nShaw also allegedly wrote on March 6, 2017 that he needed \"target practice\" when referring to the \"revitalized Russell neighborhood,\" named after African-American educator and Kentucky native Harvey Clarence Russell.\n\n\nOn Thursday, Shaw filed a motion for a restraining order or temporary injunction in a Jefferson County circuit court, seeking to have the Facebook records deemed exempt from inspection, according to court documents. The motion was denied.\n\n\nSince Shaw was the assistant police chief and acting chief for Prospect as the time of his resignation, \"that responsibility lends itself to a higher level of public scrutiny,\" Judge Judith McDonald-Burkman states in the court document.\n\n\n\"While the Court understands how embarrassing the documents may be to Shaw personally, they are not of the private nature intended to be shielded from public disclosure,\" McDonald-Burkman wrote. \"The documents reveal opinions and prejudices that bring into question Shaw's integrity as a law enforcement officer who has been entrusted to serve and protect all members of society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaw has not been charged with any crime as a result of the records, the motion states.\n\n\nMichael Burns, an attorney who represents Shaw in the civil case, told the Louisville Courier Journal that Shaw, throughout his police career, \"treated all people fairly and respectfully regardless of their race.\"\n\n\n\"His Facebook messages were made privately between colleagues and friends who shared the reality of being police officers in today\u2019s culture where police are demonized and demoralized for doing what is required to keep the community safe,\" Burns told the paper. \"Actions speak louder than words and Mr. Shaw\u2019s actions during his career speak for themselves. He is not a racist in any sense of the word.\"\n\n\nShaw resigned after the records were shared with the Prospect Police Department, which launched its own investigation, according to court documents. He started working with the department on June 4, 2012, and was not issued any reprimands or other disciplinary actions during his employment there, according to a statement from the City of Prospect.\n\n\nAfter receiving the letter from Jefferson County prosecutors, Shaw was \"immediately\" placed on paid suspension and later resigned on Nov. 20.\n\n\n\u201cWhile it is important to note that all the communications either sent or received by Shaw were sent privately, the City finds the content of the messages to be abhorrent, disgusting, and, reprehensible,\u201d said Prospect Mayor John Evans, adding that officials do not believe that any city-owned computers, cell phones or devices were used to transmit the messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recruit who Shaw had been conversing with was hired on Oct. 17, 2016 and resigned on Feb. 27, 2017, prior to graduating from the LMPD's basic academy, according to the Louisville Metro Police Department.\n\n\n\"I am disgusted by the shocking and appalling statements released today \u2013 between the former Prospect Assistant Chief of Police Todd Shaw, and a former LMPD recruit,\" LMPD Chief Steve Conrad said in a statement.\n\n\nNeither Mike Burns, Shaw's attorney in the civil case in which the messages were revealed, nor the River City Fraternal Order of Police immediately responded to ABC News' request for comment.", "title": "Former assistant police chief allegedly instructed a recruit to shoot black people", "sourceId": "abc-news", "sourceName": "ABC News", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/US/louisville-area-assistant-police-chief-allegedly-instructed-recruit/story?id=52473136", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T03:55:36Z"}, {"textData": "First,\u00a0we have the budget battle over the continuing resolution to fund the federal government. \u00a0Virtually all of the Democrats in both houses of Congress have decided that it is worth shutting down the federal government if Republicans do not agree to an amnesty\u00a0for\u00a0the approximately 800,000 DACA illegal aliens.\nThink about that for a moment. \u00a0More than 300 million American citizens benefit from the continuing operation of the federal government \u2013 most importantly through the funding of\u00a0our\u00a0armed forces. \u00a0But\u00a0virtually no\u00a0American citizens benefit from\u00a0granting\u00a0legal status and\u00a0work authorization to nearly a million illegal aliens. \u00a0\u00a0That allows the DACA aliens to\u00a0compete against United States\u00a0citizens in the same age group who are having great difficulty finding good, well-paid jobs. \nAs I have written\u00a0previously, the\u00a0DACA aliens are not kids; they are mostly young adults in their 20s and 30s competing for jobs against young Americans.\u00a0\u00a0Despite the growing economy, young American adults are struggling in the workforce, with an\u00a0unemployment rate\u00a0of nine percent. \u00a0And\u00a0young Americans without a college degree (66 percent of them) are suffering an\u00a0underemployment rate\u00a0(unemployed or seeking full time work)\u00a0that stands at a whopping 34\u00a0percent.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf one party or the other threatened a government shutdown in order to protect the\u00a0interests of American\u00a0citizens,\u00a0that\u00a0would be\u00a0one thing. \u00a0But\u00a0shutting down the government\u00a0to protect the interests of aliens who have broken our laws is something entirely different.\u00a0\u00a0And doing so to\u00a0force\u00a0a policy that hurts American citizens is unconscionable.\nThe second battle that illustrates this same disturbing disregard for American citizens is the\u00a0sanctuary cities fight. \u00a0The sanctuary cities that shelter illegal aliens from federal law enforcement are virtually all Democrat Party strongholds. \u00a0And the sanctuary state of California is firmly under Democratic control.\u00a0\u00a0Now the defense of sanctuary policies has become a rallying cry for the Democratic Party.\nBut here too, Democrats are putting Americans last. \u00a0By interfering with federal efforts to deport illegal aliens, sanctuary jurisdictions hurt American citizens. They endanger Americans\u2019 lives by keeping criminal illegal aliens on the streets of American cities. \u00a0\nThe\u00a0Kate\u00a0Steinle\u00a0murder\u00a0in San Francisco\u00a0was just\u00a0one of thousands of cases of Americans who lost their lives because of sanctuary policies. \u00a0Sanctuary policies\u00a0also endanger our constitutional system. \u00a0Sanctuary policies violate the federal\u00a0law\u00a0found at 8 U.S.C. 1373(a); and 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) makes it a federal\u00a0crime\u00a0to \u201cencourage or induce\u201d an illegal alien to remain in\u00a0the country. \u00a0When cities and states openly defy federal law, it threatens our constitutional system in the same manner that the defiant states did during the Jim Crow era.\nSo we have two national battles occurring simultaneously. \u00a0And in both battles,\u00a0Democratic leaders are putting the interests of illegal aliens over the interests of American citizens.\nThe first duty of government is to protect its own citizens. \u00a0It\u2019s so obvious that it seems silly to even have to say it. \u00a0But the leaders of the\u00a0Democratic Party have apparently forgotten that basic principle.\nIf they continue on this course,\u00a0Democratic leaders\u00a0will do damage not only to the country, but to their own party.\u00a0\u00a0A party\u2019s leadership can get away with a lot of nonsense in Washington, D.C., but some things cross the line. \u00a0If\u00a0they\u00a0continue on this course for much longer, there will likely be\u00a0millions of Democrats across the country\u00a0who\u00a0no longer recognize their own party. \u00a0They still rightly expect their government to put the interests of American citizens first.\nKris W.

The other lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, is a former Soviet military intelligence officer and an ally of Veselnitskaya who also advocates against the Magnitsky Act.\n\nBoth attended a party on Inauguration Day last year at the Library of Congress that was sponsored by Russia-friendly Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's campaign committee, The Post reported.\n\nIt was not the first time Rohrabacher had interacted with Veselnitskaya. The two also met in Moscow in April 2016 to discuss issues related to the Magnitsky Act, a law Russian President Vladimir Putin has derided as a \"purely political, unfriendly act.\"\n\nVeselnitskaya and Akhmetshin invited scrutiny last July, when news of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting first broke. Trump Jr. said in response to initial reports about the meeting that they discussed Russian adoptions and not campaign business. He was forced to amend his statement, however, when it emerged that he accepted the meeting after being offered kompromat on then Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nThat meeting, its attendees, and the Trump campaign's subsequent response have been a red-hot focus for special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional intelligence committees investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn addition to Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin \u2014 both of whom are under FBI scrutiny \u2014 at least four other politically influential Russians attended Trump's Inauguration Day celebrations last year, according to The Post.\n\n'Kremlin Connection'\n\nWealthy Russian pharmaceutical executive Alexey Repik and his wife were there, as was energy tycoon Viktor Vekselberg. Vekselberg is said to be closely aligned with Putin, with whom he frequently meets to discuss business. According to federal filings reviewed by The Post, two of Vekselberg's American associates donated a combined $1.25 million to Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nAlso in attendance was Russian presidential candidate Boris Titov. Though Titov is running as a liberal-leaning competitor to Putin in the country's 2018 presidential race, he is part of the Kremlin establishment and is friends with the Russian leader, according to The Moscow Times.\n\nAvid gun rights activist Maria Butina was also there. The Daily Beast reported last year that Butina has referred to herself at various times as a Russian central bank staffer, a gun enthusiast, a graduate student (she studies at American University in Washington, D.C.), a journalist, \"a representative of the Russian Federation,\" and a link between the Trump campaign and Russia. She also served as an assistant to Putin-allied Russian banker and politician Alexander Torshin, who has been accused in the past of money laundering and other financial crimes.\n\nButina had a birthday party on November 12, 2016, four days after Trump was elected, at a cafe near American University, according to the report. The gathering featured several top Trump campaign advisers and National Rifle Association activist and Republican strategist Paul Erickson, who reportedly told attendees Butina was on the Trump transition team. Butina and Erickson have been acquainted since at least 2013, and Erickson has touted himself as being well-connected to the Kremlin.\n\nErickson invited scrutiny last year, when The New York Times reported that he emailed Trump campaign aide Rick Dearborn in May 2016, with the subject line \"Kremlin Connection,\" telling him that he could arrange a backdoor meeting between Trump and Putin.\n\nRussia is \"quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the US,\" Erickson wrote, according to the email, which was described to The Times. He added that Russia would try to make contact with the Trump campaign at the NRA's annual convention in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTorshin was the individual designated to make \"first contact\" with Trump from Russia's side. Erickson described him in his email as \"President Putin's emissary on this front.\"\n\nErickson wrote that Torshin would make \"first contact\" with the campaign at a dinner honoring wounded veterans that was organized by conservative Christian advocate Rick Clay, the report said. Neither Trump nor his campaign advisers attended the reception. Trump Jr. and Torshin did, however, attend a separate NRA dinner the same night.\n\nInvestigators are said to be reviewing the correspondence and any others related to Dearborn, Erickson, Clay, and Torshin. The FBI, in particular, appears to be homing in on Torshin's role in leveraging the NRA to influence the US election.\n\nMcClatchy reported this week that the bureau is looking into whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA to help sway the race in Trump's favor. The NRA, according to the report, said it spent a record $55 million on the election, most of which came from a sector of the organization that isn't required to disclose its donors.\n\nThe US's former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, told The Post it was \"strange\" that so many Putin-linked individuals attended Trump's inauguration.\n\nBut Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who served as Senior Director of the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said he wasn't surprised.\n\n\"This team courted and potentially colluded with the Russians since day one without any apparent shame,\" he said in an email. \"I would've been surprised had prominent Russians NOT attended the inauguration.

Lebanon is holding its first parliamentary elections in nearly ten years in May. The government and local groups, with help from the United Nations and the European Union, are campaigning to get at least five times more women elected to the parliament, a daunting task in this country that may look like the Middle East\u2019s most liberal. (Bilal Hussein/Associated Press)\n\nBEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon is campaigning to get at least five times more women elected to parliament this spring in its first vote in nearly 10 years, the country\u2019s first women\u2019s affairs minister says.\n\nIt is a daunting task for a Middle Eastern country that may otherwise look like one of the most liberal in the region.\n\nDespite a relatively free press, diverse religious groups and women in prominent positions in the business world and the media, Lebanon ranks surprisingly low when it comes to female representation in politics, and politicians have failed to act on a movement to institute a quota for women in parliament.\n\n\u201cKeeping women from public life is not only a loss for women. It is a loss for the parliament,\u201d Minister of State for Women\u2019s Affairs Jean Oghassabian told The Associated Press. \u201cThe main obstacles are mentality, a philosophy of life, and this needs time,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are only four women in the outgoing parliament elected in 2009, a flimsy 3 percent of its 128 lawmakers. It was a drop from 2005, when six women were elected. Since 2004, there have been one or at most two posts for women in government.\n\nCompared to other countries in the region, Lebanon ranks as one of the lowest in terms of female representation in parliament, with only Oman, Kuwait and Yemen having fewer. Oman and Kuwait have one and two women representatives respectively. War-torn Yemen has none and is currently without a functioning parliament.\n\nEven in ultraconservative Saudi Arabia, the monarch appointed 30 women to the consultative Shura Council, giving them nearly 20 percent of the seats.\n\n\u201cIn politics, there seems to be some kind of invisible barrier for women to really break through,\u201d Christina Lassen, European Union Ambassador to Lebanon, told The Associated Press at a conference held last week to promote women\u2019s representation.\n\nThree months before the vote, the Women\u2019s Affairs Ministry in collaboration with the United Nations and the EU launched a campaign to boost women\u2019s numbers in the elections, with the slogan: \u201cHalf the society, half the parliament.\u201d\n\nBillboards went up in several Beirut districts. Programs on local TV stations about women in politics are airing weekly and local groups say they are training women candidates on public speaking.\n\nOghassabian said last year\u2019s decision to appoint a man to the newly created portfolio was meant to send a message that it is also \u201ca man\u2019s duty\u201d to fight for women\u2019s rights.\n\nHolding parliamentary elections in Lebanon is a feat in itself. Scheduled for May, these are the first elections in the country since 2009. Previous votes were delayed amid instability and haggling over a new election law.\n\nSeats in the Lebanese parliament are allotted according to sects, with each community distributing them according to region and strongholds. In this complex confessional-based political system, adding a women\u2019s quota was too complicated for some to contemplate, said Nora Mourad, a gender researcher with the United Nations Development Program.\n\nLast year, the politicians refused to even discuss a female quota in the new law. Members of the powerful Shiite group, Hezbollah, walked out of the room before the discussion began.\n\n\u201cWe are against a quota. We are against imposing conditions from the outside on our policies and roles and work,\u201d said Rima Fakhry, a politician from the conservative Shiite group. \u201cThe women movement considers that women should reach decision-making positions. For them it is in parliament. We differ with those movements.\u201d\n\nAlthough Fakhry herself is a senior member of the political bureau of Hezbollah, she told the audience at the conference that her group doesn\u2019t see the role of a lawmaker as befitting for a woman in Lebanon. Her group won\u2019t nominate women to run for office.\n\n\u201cFor us, the woman is a woman. She must work to realize the main goals she exists for. These are not different from those of men. But the difference is in the details,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has a home. She is a mother and must bring up generations. This takes a lot of the woman\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nEven though the country\u2019s civil war ended 28 years ago, its politics are still dominated by former warlords and family dynasties, and elections are often settled behind closed doors.\n\nMost women in politics have their posts because they are related to influential male politicians. Of the four women currently in parliament, one is the aunt of the current prime minister, another is the wife of a party leader, and the other two are the daughters of an assassinated media figure and a former minister.\n\nStill, Oghassabian said he expects at least 20 women to make it into parliament, and dozens more to run.\n\nThe new law introduced a complicated proportional representation system that would preserve the sectarian nature of the parliament. But some argue it will offer women and independents a better chance.\n\nLocal groups, along with the U.N. and EU, are encouraging political parties to have a voluntary quota for women on their lists. Women\u2019s groups are contemplating all-women lists as well as a campaign of \u201cno-woman, no-vote\u201d to pressure political parties to include women on their lists.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s conference, representatives from the political parties said internal deliberations are ongoing. One senior member of the Future party said he will recommend 20 percent women\u2019s representation. Another, from the Progressive Socialist Party, said it has commissioned a review of internal literature to ensure women\u2019s issues and requests are reflected.\n\nVictoria El-Khoury Zwein, a potential candidate with a new party called Seven, said she\u2019s skeptical that veteran parties would give women a winning chance. But she said with proportional representation, she\u2019s optimistic she needs fewer votes to make it.\n\n\u201cThere must be 15 percent of the population who want a new political class,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not an easy battle.

(Raad Adayleh/Associated Press)\n\nAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is defending President Donald Trump\u2019s move to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel, a decision that has touched off uneasiness among Arab nations on his first tour of the region.\n\nPence was to meet Sunday with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II for discussions that are expected to include last month\u2019s shift on Jerusalem and plans to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested holy city.\n\nThe vice president said after meeting Saturday with Egypt\u2019s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi that he emphasized the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nPence said he assured el-Sissi the U.S. was committed to \u201cpreserving the status quo with regard to holy sites in Jerusalem,\u201d and that borders and other issues would be negotiated between the parties.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America is deeply committed to restarting the peace process in the Middle East,\u201d Pence said before departing for Jordan. He said he would be \u201cdelivering that message in Jordan, delivering that message in Israel, as well.\u201d\n\nEl-Sissi said in a statement after the meeting that he affirmed Egypt\u2019s \u201cunyielding position\u201d in support of the Palestinians\u2019 right to establish an independent state with east Jerusalem as its capital. He said the conflict could only be resolved through negotiations leading to a two-state solution.\n\nIsrael views Jerusalem as its unified capital, while the Palestinians demand east Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their future state. A longstanding international consensus holds that the city\u2019s final status should be decided through negotiations, which was also U.S. policy going back decades.\n\nArab and Muslim nations support the Palestinians\u2019 claim to east Jerusalem, and the Trump administration\u2019s shift ignited protests across the region.\n\nAhead of Pence\u2019s arrival, several dozen Jordanians gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Amman, protesting against U.S. policies in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAmerica is the head of the snake,\u201d they chanted. Some held up a banner reading: \u201cThe envoy of the Zionist American right-wing is not welcome.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s dramatic policy shift on Jerusalem has posed a dilemma for Jordan\u2019s monarch, a staunch U.S. ally.\n\nPalestinians make up a large segment of Jordan\u2019s population, and the ruling Hashemite monarchy derives some of its political legitimacy from its historic role as custodian of Jerusalem\u2019s main Muslim shrine, the Al-Aqsa mosque, which is Islam\u2019s third holiest site.\n\nAny perceived threats to Muslim claims to the city, such as Trump\u2019s shift on Jerusalem, undermine its vital role there.\n\nAt the same time, Jordan relies on U.S. military and economic aid \u2014 $1.5 billion in 2015 and $1.6 billion last year \u2014 at a time of a worsening economic downturn and rising unemployment.\n\nPence was also expected to meet with U.S. troops in the region on Sunday and then depart for Israel, where he\u2019s scheduled to hold meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, deliver an address to the Knesset and visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nNetanyahu has said he\u2019ll soon decide on Israel\u2019s new ambassador to Jordan after the two countries agreed to move past a diplomatic row. Israel media reported Netanyahu as saying Israel had expressed remorse over a shooting at its Amman embassy last summer that killed two Jordanians.\n\nIsrael\u2019s ambassador returned to Israel along with the guard involved in the shooting. The guard claimed self-defense and received a hero\u2019s welcome at home, angering Jordanians.\n\nThe incident has strained relations between the countries, which signed a peace agreement in 1994 and cooperate on security and other issues.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Karin Laub contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

All ears will be tuned in Sunday to any final words Francis might share on a crisis he had hoped to help mend in a visit to usually friendly Latin American turf.\n\nDuring his seven-day trip Chile and Peru Francis personally apologized to survivors of priests who sexually abused them, traveled deep into the Amazon to meet with indigenous leaders, decried the scourge of corruption and violence against women in Latin America and urged the Chilean government and radical Mapuche factions to peacefully resolve one of the region\u2019s longest-running disputes.\n\nBut the pope also attracted unprecedented rejection: At least a dozen churches across Chile were set aflame and riot police shot tear gas and arrested protesters who tried marching in on Mass in Santiago.\n\nFrancis stirred outrage when he accused victims of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile priest of slander.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained at a historically low level, compared with past presidents. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAmericans have reached a split-screen assessment of the state of the country at the end of President Trump\u2019s first year in office, expressing the most positive views about the economy in nearly two decades while giving Trump historically low approval, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News survey.\n\nThis stark contrast between perceptions of the economy and assessments of the president continue a pattern that has existed since Trump was sworn in a year ago, that of a president whose personal actions and behavior have stirred controversy and created a political distraction in the face of steady growth, low unemployment and record gains in the stock market.\n\nHow voters weigh those two views will have a decided impact on the upcoming midterm elections. Democrats, who see an opportunity take back control of the House and have a possible although uphill path to control of the Senate, will seek to make the November elections about Trump. Republicans hope perceptions of the economy will influence enough voters to hold down their expected losses enough to protect that House majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new survey finds that 58 percent of all Americans give positive ratings to the state of the economy. That is the highest in a Post-ABC survey in 17 years and seven points higher than on the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration. At the same time, Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained at a historically low level, compared with past presidents. Today, 36 percent approve of the job Trump is doing, while 58 percent disapprove, little changed over the past few months. Strong disapproval of the president, at 49 percent overall, remains twice as high as strong approval, which stands at 24 percent.\n\n[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted]\n\nThe public is evenly divided overall and deeply split along partisan lines on three major policy initiatives of the Trump presidency \u2014 the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants, a reduction in federal regulations on businesses, and an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce. More than 4 in 10 support those policies, and an almost-identical percentage oppose them. But the level of support is slightly higher than Trump\u2019s approval rating, meaning that some Americans \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 who disapprove of the president support those policies.\n\nOn two of the biggest policy debates of the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 health care and taxes \u2014 the public comes down in opposition to the direction pursued by the administration and congressional Republicans. A majority (57 percent) say the continuation of the Affordable Care Act is a good thing, in essence an expression of relief that Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare as they had long promised to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the big tax bill passed by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump at the end of last year, 46 percent say it is bad for the country while 34 percent say it is good for the country. That is slightly better than when people were asked whether they supported or opposed the measure as it was being debated. Notably, 20 percent say they have no opinion or are ambivalent about the tax bill, which is likely to become a pivotal battleground for public opinion between the parties ahead of the November midterm elections.\n\nThe gap between the president\u2019s low approval and the somewhat higher level of support for some of his policies reflects the disconnect between how people see the president and how they view some of his priorities. For example, 21 percent of Democrats who disapprove of the president say the crackdown on undocumented immigrants is a good thing for the country. The same percentage of disapproving Democrats say reducing federal regulations on business is good for the country.\n\nFor their part, Democrats are struggling to convey a message beyond being anti-Trump, with just over 3 in 10 saying they are presenting alternatives to Trump\u2019s proposals. A 53 percent majority say the Democratic Party is mainly criticizing the president without offering alternatives.\n\nAs the president begins his second year in office, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and possible cooperation, collusion or knowledge of what was taking place by associates of the Trump campaign continues. Trump has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d although it has produced two guilty pleas, including one from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and charges against Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, and an associate of Manafort\u2019s.\n\nToday, 50 percent of Americans approve of the way Mueller is proceeding compared with 31 percent who disapprove, with 19 percent expressing no opinion. In early November, 58 percent approved of Mueller\u2019s handling, but in recent weeks, Republicans have targeted the investigation as biased. Among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, approval of Mueller has dropped from 39 percent in November to 30 percent in the new poll.\n\nHalf of all Americans also say they believe Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Russians, and an almost identical percentage say they believe the president tried to interfere with the investigation. Just over a quarter, 26 percent, say they believe there is solid evidence to buttress this latter assessment.\n\nThe impact of Trump\u2019s leadership on the public is mixed to negative. Six in 10 Americans say he has accomplished little or nothing. That is better than the 65 percent who said this in November, before passage of the tax bill, but it is a worse rating than received by former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at a similar point in their first terms. A bare majority (53 percent) say Trump\u2019s actions have made no difference to them and their families. The rest are roughly split about the effect of his presidency on them, with 26 percent saying his actions have hurt and 20 percent saying they\u2019ve helped.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the economy, Trump receives less credit for the gains seen over the past than does his predecessor, Obama. Fewer than 4 in 10, 38 percent, say the Trump administration deserves significant credit for the state of the economy while 50 percent say the Obama administration should get credit. Republicans and Democrats have sharply opposite views of where the credit should go. Among independents, one-third say Trump should get credit, compared with about half who give credit to Obama.\n\nAbout 1 in 4 Americans rate the economy positively while disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance. Three-quarters of them are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, and most of the group says Obama deserves credit for the current state of the economy, not Trump. Even more important is the fact that almost all of them say Trump has acted in a way that is not presidential, one indicator of how his personal behavior has clouded his presidency.\n\nThe survey finds that Trump and the Republicans have so far failed to shift public opinion on key elements of their agenda. Republican leaders have said that the new tax law \u2014 the party\u2019s biggest accomplishment to date \u2014 will provide lower taxes for most middle-class families. But at this point, 60 percent of Americans see the new measure overall as favoring the rich rather than the middle class or the poor.\n\nOpposition to Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to curtail illegal immigration remains strong, with 63 percent of Americans saying they are against it, including 52 percent who strongly oppose. But 71 percent of Republicans support the proposal, including 58 percent who support it strongly. The gulf between Republicans on one side and Democrats and independents on the other underscores why this part of border security has been a sticking point in budget negotiations between the two parties.\n\nCongress has been at a stalemate over the future of the Obama-era policy that protected from deportation undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children. The issue has been a point of contention in recent days as Congress has struggled to reach a spending agreement. Trump rescinded the Obama program last fall and asked Congress to come up with a solution by March. So far that fix has eluded negotiators.\n\nPublic opinion is clear on this issue, with 87 percent of Americans saying they support a continuation of the protection for those undocumented young people who have completed high school or served in the military and who have no serious criminal record. On this, there is bipartisan agreement among overwhelming majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\nTrump\u2019s behavior and fitness shape the other track of his presidency, to his detriment. Seven in 10 Americans say he has acted in a way that is not presidential, while a quarter say his behavior has been fitting and proper for the nation\u2019s chief executive. About 2 in 3 say the president\u2019s use of Twitter has hurt his presidency. A bare majority (52 percent) say he is biased against black people.\n\nThe president in a recent tweet, which came after a renewed round of questions about his stability in light of a new book that described him in unflattering terms, said he was both mentally stable and a \u201cgenius\u201d for being able to win the White House in his first try for public office. On those two questions, Americans are almost split evenly about his mental stability but by better than 3 to 1 say he is not a genius.\n\nTrump recently underwent a physical examination that included a test aimed at detecting mild cognitive impairment.

Gunmen stormed the hotel in the Afghan capital on Saturday evening, triggering a shootout with security forces, officials said. (Rahmat Gul/Associated Press)\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Gunmen stormed the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul, killing at least five people, including a foreigner, and setting off a 12-hour gun battle with security forces that continued into Sunday morning, as frantic guests tried to escape from fourth and fifth-floor windows.\n\nSix other people, including three security forces, were reported wounded and more than 150 people, including 41 foreigners, have been rescued from the hotel, said Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish.\n\nThe bodies of three attackers were recovered as security forces continued to clear the landmark building, he said. \u201cFor the time being we can only confirm that one foreigner was among those who were killed in the attack,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe security forces are going room-by-room to make sure that there are no more attackers in the building,\u201d Danish said.\n\nThe Intercontinental Hotel is located on a hilltop in the Bagh-e Bala area of the capital and is heavily guarded because it hosts both Afghan and foreign guests as well as official conferences. Last night\u2019s attack unfolded almost six years after Taliban insurgents launched a similar assault. The property is not part of the InterContinental chain of worldwide hotels.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said a private firm assumed responsibility for securing the hotel around three weeks ago. The ministry says it is investigating how the attackers managed to enter the building.\n\nAfghan security officials confirmed that 34 provincial officials were gathered at the hotel to participate in a conference organized by the Telecommunication Ministry.\n\nNo one has immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which started around 9 p.m. Saturday. As the fighting raged, a fire broke out. Firefighters are still battling the blaze. Live TV footage showed people trying to escape through windows on the upper stories.\n\nCapt. Tom Gresback, spokesman for NATO-led forces, said in a statement that Afghan forces were leading the response efforts. He said that according to initial reports, no foreign troops were hurt in the attack.\n\nNeighboring Pakistan condemned the \u201cbrutal terrorist attack\u201d and called for greater cooperation against militants. Afghanistan and Pakistan routinely accuse each other of failing to combat extremists along their long and porous border.\n\nAfghan forces have struggled to combat the Taliban since the U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014.

(Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Koreans seem generally happy they\u2019ll see the North Koreans at their Olympics, but aren\u2019t as pleased about sharing a team with them.\n\nThe agreement between the war-separated rivals to field a unified women\u2019s ice hockey team at February\u2019s Winter Olympics has triggered a debate in South Korea, where there\u2019s no longer strong public clamor for reunification or for using sports to make political statements.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who views the Pyeongchang Games as an opportunity to improve relations following a year of tension over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, said the unified team would provide a \u201chistorically grand moment\u201d once it appears on ice.\n\nOther reconciliatory gestures the Koreas have agreed to for the Olympics include a joint march under a blue-and-white \u201cunification\u201d flag during the Feb. 9 opening ceremony and a pair of performances by a visiting North Korean art troupe. The joint march and the unified hockey team were approved Saturday by the International Olympic Committee, which allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the games in exceptional entries given to the North.\n\nNot all South Koreans are in the mood. There are apparently few objections to the North Korean presence at the Olympics itself, which likely ensures that the country holds off any significant weapons test or other aggressive acts that would risk disrupting the games.\n\nMany South Koreans believe their government went too far by pushing athletes into a \u201cpolitical show\u201d that will likely become meaningless once the lull in tensions breaks down after the Olympics.\n\nKim Hye-jin, a 39-year-old music instructor, said that South Korea was repeating an \u201coutdated approach\u201d in using sports diplomacy. She said that the previous unified teams and joint marches between the rivals never paved the way for sustained, meaningful engagement.\n\n\u201cWe are always repeating meaningless things and North Korea isn\u2019t a country that will change easily,\u201d she said.\n\nPlus, she said, a unified team takes away opportunities from South Korean athletes who have been working hard to prepare for the Olympics.\n\nHeo Doo-won, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, didn\u2019t care for the reconciliatory gestures at all.\n\n\u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe are clearly two different countries and it\u2019s better if things stay that way. I don\u2019t want a unified team or a unification flag. Why can\u2019t we just let the North Koreans march under their own flag?\u201d\n\nWhile the liberal Moon remains a popular president nine months into his term, the controversy over the hockey team factored in his approval rating dipping below 70 percent for the first time in four months, according to a Gallup Korea report on Friday.\n\nMany people sympathize with the South Korean athletes who would likely be sacrificing opportunities for the North\u2019s players, who are considered less skilled and experienced. The IOC approved an expanded roster of 35 instead of 22 for the joint team, but only the normal number will be allowed to suit up for each game and three of them must be North Korean.\n\nThe South Korean team\u2019s Canadian coach, Sarah Murray, has expressed concerns over chemistry.\n\n\u201cAdding somebody so close to the Olympics is a little bit dangerous just for team chemistry because the girls have been together for so long,\u201d she said last week.\n\nChoi Hyuk, a 40-year-old office worker, blamed the government for failing to properly communicate with the players and for excessively politicizing sports.\n\nChoi pointed to the comments of Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, who was forced to apologize after saying that the South Korean women\u2019s hockey team was out of \u201cmedal range\u201d anyway while defending the government\u2019s decision to create the unified team.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s elite sports have always been based on nationalism,\u201d Choi said, referring to a decades-long system that rewards Olympic medal winners with lifelong cash payments and exemption from military duties that are mandatory for most able-bodied men.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny that the same country is now asking athletes to cut back on their playing time and embrace changes that would make them less likely to win?\u201d\n\nThe reconciliation mood between the Koreas began after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year\u2019s speech that he was willing to send a delegation to the Olympics.\n\nSome experts view Kim\u2019s overture as an attempt to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and buy time to further advance his nuclear weapons program. Last year, North Korea carried out its sixth and biggest nuclear test and test-fired three intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has shown no willingness to give up its ambitions.\n\nStill, many experts think Moon\u2019s government made the right move in jumping at the opportunity to resume contact with North Korea after nearly two years of diplomatic stalemate and animosity.\n\nIn an annual policy report on Friday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said it aims to use the Olympics as an opportunity to re-establish regular dialogue with North Korea. The resumption of inter-Korean talks is crucial for the policies of Moon, who wants Seoul in the driver\u2019s seat in international efforts to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat.\n\nThe Koreas sent joint teams to major international sporting events twice in 1991, and had their athletes march together in the opening and closing ceremonies of several sporting events in the 2000s, including the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile the previous moves had little diplomatic impact, similar gestures would carry more meaning in an Olympics held on South Korean soil and amid higher stakes in regional security, said Yongchul Chung, a sports education professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.\n\n\u201cFielding a unified team is very meaningful \u2014 the biggest fruit that can come from the Pyeongchang Olympics is a message of peace between the Koreas,\u201d Chung said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the players wouldn\u2019t understand the historic significance of what they are involved in.\u201d\n\nBut it has become harder to get South Koreans excited for unified teams and joint marches when North Korea\u2019s increasingly aggressive weapons tests and the South\u2019s own evolvement as an economy and society continue to erode the public\u2019s enthusiasm for reunification.\n\nIn a survey of 1,200 adults released by Seoul National University in October, 53.8 percent of the respondents said they supported the idea of reunification. This represented a steep drop from the 63.8 percent measured in 2007, when the school started the annual survey.\n\n\u201cI think it will be emotionally moving to watch the athletes of both Koreas march under the same flag during the opening ceremony as we come from the same nation,\u201d said Oh Ju-yeon, a 46-year-old housewife. \u201cBut after the games, there will be bitterness from realizing that nothing\u2019s really going to change.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A blatant falsehood from the White House podium.\n\nAnd that was just the first 24 hours.\n\nIn his first year in office, Donald Trump proved to be a singular figure, casting aside norms and traditions, fighting with Republicans and Democrats alike and changing how the nation and the presidency are viewed at home and abroad.\n\nSeemingly each day spawned several can-you-believe-it headlines that would have defined a previous president\u2019s term. But in the hyper-accelerated Trump news cycle, many were forgotten by the next morning.\n\nAppropriate for a former reality TV star, Trump\u2019s first year was can\u2019t-miss drama, full of unforgettable characters, surprise casting changes and innumerable plot twists. It came against the backdrop of a deeply polarized nation, a looming nuclear threat, whispers about the president\u2019s fitness for office and, for good measure, the shadow of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe reviews weren\u2019t kind. Trump\u2019s first-year approval rating stood at 39 percent, the lowest of any president. But viewers couldn\u2019t look away.\n\n\u201cHe is a compulsively watchable political character,\u201d said Jon Meacham, presidential historian and biographer. \u201cThe country elected the most unconventional president in our history and he has proven to be just that. To me, the story of the first year is the atmospheric chaos that the president has created, sustained and perpetuated.\u201d\n\nTrump was the first president to be elected without any government or military experience. And from the first moments of Trump\u2019s inauguration, it was clear that Washington had never seen anything like this before.\n\nHis inaugural speech was a dark pitch to the nation\u2019s forgotten, suggesting a retreat from the world under the slogan of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d It soon led to an uproar over the White House press secretary\u2019s wild claims about the inauguration crowd size.\n\nSoon, other crowds were the story.\n\nMillions of people flooded streets around the globe for the \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d to protest Trump\u2019s presidency. That set the template for the so-called #Resistance, which swarmed airports just days later when the White House suddenly announced its travel ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThere would be little attempt from Trump to bring those protesters into the fold. Despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, the president forged forward as if elected with a sweeping mandate, aiming his policies directly at his base \u2014 with moves such as the rollback of environment regulations and civil rights protections \u2014 and blaming Democrats for any Washington failure.\n\nAlways eager to have a foe, Trump governed as he campaigned, and not just by incessantly reliving his 2016 election over Hillary Clinton. Trump frequently instigated fights and rarely let a slight go unanswered via his favorite weapon, his Twitter account.\n\nAny pre-inauguration talk of restraining his Twitter usage was soon forgotten. He used the 140-character \u2014 and later, up to 280 \u2014 bursts to target foes, traffic in conspiracy theories, salute the programming on Fox News, rattle Congress and unnerve world capitals. In March, he even made the unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor had wiretapped Trump Tower, and he labeled President Barack Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy.\u201d\n\nThe trail of tweets has roiled the capital for 12 months. Across Washington, phones would buzz with alerts anytime Trump tweeted. Republicans found themselves to be targets of Trump\u2019s tweet just like Democrats, particularly when their efforts to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 a plan seven years in the making \u2014 failed not once, but twice.\n\nSome tweets drew puzzlement; none more than the president\u2019s late-night posting of the nonsensical word \u201ccovfefe.\u201d\n\nSome tweets challenged American institutions, full of criticisms of the media and the FBI. Others provoked outrage, as when he suggested that MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski had a face-lift or claimed that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., \u201cwould do anything\u201d for a donation, an unsavory insinuation made at the height of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe discussion about sexual harassment toppled many powerful men but, while Trump\u2019s own accusers resurfaced, the White House never changed its story: The women were lying.\n\nThat was just one of many moments in which Trump appeared almost eager to foment divisions, including racial ones.\n\nHis political career was launched on the lie that Obama was not born in the United States, and this month, Trump was denounced for dismissing African nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d when he urged a limit on immigration from that continent.\n\nHe dismissed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d mocking her claims about being part Native American, while addressing a group of American Indians. More divisively, he blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence between neo-Nazis and anti-hate group protesters that left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nWhile Trump was rewriting the rules of behavior within the Oval Office, his agenda was largely lifted from the Republican playbook and his first year victories thrilled the GOP orthodoxy. He appointed conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, rolled back business regulations, presided over a massive tax cut and, the White House argued, fostered an environment that freed the stock market to boom.\n\n\u201c2017 was a year of tremendous achievement (and) the achievements for our country, our people, and for our standing in the world have been very monumental,\u201d Trump said at a Cabinet meeting last week, before offering a glimpse into how he views the presidency \u2014 as catnip for cable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure their ratings were fantastic. They always are,\u201d he said.\n\nLike any president, Trump faced crises during his first year.\n\nMost ominously, North Korea escalated its nuclear weapons development program while Trump responded with unprecedentedly bellicose rhetoric. He warned of \u201cfire and fury\u201d that could wipe out Pyongyang. At the United Nations, he insulted North Korean leader Kim Jung Un as \u201cLittle Rocket Man.\u201d Trump took to Twitter to suggest that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim\u2019s.\n\nThe anniversary of his inauguration coincided with a government shutdown, and he scoffed that Democrats \u201cwanted to give me a nice present.\u201d\n\nHe traveled overseas four times, upbraiding traditional American allies at NATO for not paying enough, basking in the flattery of Chinese President Xi Jinping and touching a mysterious, glowing orb with Saudi King Salman.\n\nHis responses to domestic tragedies were uneven.\n\nHe paid tribute to the 58 victims of a shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas, but made no effort to toughen gun control laws. When Hurricane Maria crushed Puerto Rico, leaving half the island without power for months, Trump feuded with a local mayor and, during a visit, distributed paper towels to survivors by shooting them like they were basketballs.\n\nBefitting a man whose reality show ended with a firing each week, in Trump\u2019s first year his administration\u2019s upper-level officials have had a turnover rate of 34 percent, much higher than any other in the past 40 years. Gone were chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer and, after just 11 eventful days, communications director Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nBut the circumstances of two exits above all may define not just Trump\u2019s first year in office, but those to follow.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Flynn was fired less than a month into the term for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with foreign officials. In May, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\nThat dismissal led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose probe into possible collusion and obstruction of justice has hovered over the White House. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and is now cooperating with Mueller. Trump himself may at some point be interviewed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a president who had such a chaotic first year. Every day is topsy-turvy and disorganized, the country has not been so divided since the Civil War and Trump thrives at being the bull that carries his own china shop around with him,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cHe\u2019s not like anything we\u2019ve seen before and this is the question: What are the consequences going to be?\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It was also Republicans, who grumbled just as loudly that they were not sure who in the White House was negotiating to end a partial government shutdown.\n\nWhich Trump was it: The ultimate deal-maker eager to deliver what eluded his predecessors from both parties or the firebrand who rode a hardline immigration stance to power? As with so many other moments of consequence for his presidency, it seemed the last person to speak with Trump determined his position.\n\nFor the President, it was not how he anticipated spending the one-year anniversary of his inauguration.\n\nThe White House\u2019s budget director and legislative liaison made the rounds at the Capitol. Its press secretary called lawmakers \u201closers.\u201d The chief of staff seemed to reverse his boss\u2019 compromises with Senate Democrats and protect the President\u2019s right flank. Trump, surrounded by protesters outside the White House gates, was trolling them on Twitter and raging that Congress was not bending to his will.\n\nSome Republicans marveled that the focus for many leaders in the party was on shifting blame and scoring wins, not finding a way to reopen the government.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a lead negotiator in the immigration talks that are central to the crisis. \u201cThe idea of letting this continue to fester is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, remained unwilling to incorporate protections for the roughly 800,000 young people who were brought to the country illegally as children. Democrats have conditioned their votes to fund the government on protections for those young people, known as Dreamers. Trump last year ended temporary protections for those individuals and told Congress to pass a replacement.\n\nOn Saturday, top White House officials optimistically called it \u201ca tangential issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House position remains the same: we will not negotiate the status of 690,000 unlawful immigrants while hundreds of millions of tax-paying Americans \u2026 are held hostage by Senate Democrats,\u201d White House legislative director Marc Short told reporters on Saturday. \u201cWe hope Senate Democrats will yield.\u201d\n\nBut the rhetoric didn\u2019t invite compromise. \u201cIt\u2019s like a two-year-old\u2019s temper tantrum,\u201d Short said.\n\nThe White House budget director Mick Mulvaney insisted all talk of the funding lapse should be branded \u201cSchumer Shutdown,\u201d after Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cIt has that nice little ring to it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Mulvaney said, again arguing that talks with Schumer were fruitless. \u201cAt what point does it even become profitable to continue to work with someone like that?\u201d\n\nBut if Republicans hope to reopen the government, the White House will need to work with Schumer and his caucus, where retreat was not an appealing option as Day One of the shutdown unfolded. Schumer\u2019s top deputy, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, briefed House Democrats on Saturday morning behind closed doors. From outside, cheers were audible, signaling a compromise was unlikely.\n\n\u201cThe President created this challenge on September 5th,\u201d Durbin told TIME outside the Capitol in the early hours of Saturday morning as he prepared to make his way home after a long night. It was on Sept. 5 that Trump declared an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, that protected many of the Dreamers.\n\n\u201cThe Republican-controlled House and Senate have not produced a single bill to respond to this,\u201d an exhausted Durbin said. \u201cThe President put the fates of these young people in doubt, and we have a responsibility to do something to help them.\u201d\n\nThat call to action was echoed throughout the day as lawmakers marveled how a program Trump backed as late as last week suddenly was the sticking point.\n\n\u201cThe only way out of this is for the President to take \u2018yes\u2019 for an answer,\u201d said Schumer, who met with the President for 90 minutes over cheeseburgers late Friday afternoon. Schumer thought he was close to an off-ramp and indicated he could convince his colleagues to give the President some of the money needed for his border wall.\n\nFrantically, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell phoned the White House urging the President to stand firm against any deal shorter than four weeks and to void any hopes of compromise with Schumer. He also phoned House Speaker Paul Ryan and urged him to hold the line against compromise.\n\nAt the White House, advisers told the President that the Democrats\u2019 offer was only for one year of border building, not the whole costs. That, for the moment, talked him away from dealmaker and back toward his hardline stance.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly phoned Schumer on Friday to tell him that a short-term deal was not possible under these conditions.\n\n\u201cNegotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\u201d Schumer fumed from the Senate floor midday Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to that President? He backed off at the first sign of pressure,\u201d Schumer said, casting the President as a choke artist \u2014 a gamble that could provoke Trump.\n\nRepublicans continued to shove blame on the Democrats. They accused their colleagues across the aisle of placing politics above the health and well-being of American children, since the failed spending package contained funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which lapsed in September. They rejected the notion that their own party \u2014 which controls both chambers of Congress, and which has failed to bring CHIP to the floor in the four months since it lapsed \u2014 bore any responsibility.\n\n\u201cBottom line, this was a clean bill, and it\u2026 is so obvious that they are putting the Obama legacy ahead taking care of children and supporting our troops,\u201d Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins of West Virginia told TIME.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Capitol on Saturday, other House Republicans held their ground. Throughout this entire process \u2014 the tentative progress towards an immigration deal last week; the negotiations of a spending bill after that progress collapsed \u2014 these lawmakers had been the biggest hurdle to compromise. Unlike their more moderate colleagues in the Senate, a powerful faction of conservatives in the House is rigidly opposed to a bipartisan solution on DACA, preferring instead a hardline bill that would restrict immigration and amplify domestic enforcement.\n\nBut when asked if her colleagues would be amenable to an immigration compromise, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the fourth-ranking House Republican, demurred. \u201cThe first order of business is to get the government funded,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more time [on immigration] \u2014 and that should not be used to put the country through this shutdown.\u201d\n\nThere were whispers of disagreement among Republican leaders on the Hill. Reports indicated McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan were not on the same page; aides to each disputed those reports strongly.\n\nYet, there are limits to how much McConnell can unilaterally do. Spending bills have to start in the House, and it\u2019s not clear Republicans in both chambers were of the same mind, or where the President might be on a final compromise. Ryan has a rowdy caucus to manage, McConnell will need Democratic votes to reach the 60-vote threshold to fund the government, and the President has proven unpredictable.\n\nFor his part, McConnell sought a way out of the crisis that didn\u2019t hinge on the President\u2019s consistency. He offered a possible deal to reopen the government through Feb. 8 \u2014 or so \u2014 and fund a health insurance program for poor kids for six years in exchange for a pledge that talks will resume on an immigration deal that would protect Dreamers. The three-week funding bill is a one-week reduction from the proposal that failed late Friday, a difference that seemed to make no difference to Democrats, especially if promises from the President were in the mix.\n\n\u201cThis President just does not have a reputation for telling the truth,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California.\n\nAs the Democrats huddled to discuss their options, they looked up to see split-screen coverage of a stand-still Capitol and scores of women marching against Trump\u2019s agenda. Any skittishness about the decision to shutter government melted as they saw the grassroots activists filling streets from San Diego to New York. Republicans are worried they could lose their majorities in the House and maybe the Senate in this fall\u2019s elections, and maintaining this energy among liberal activists is crucial.\n\n\u201cAll I can tell you is there are a lot of meetings going on. I just came from one,\u201d Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent, told TIME on Saturday afternoon as he walked down a hallway in the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The building was quiet and seemingly empty. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d say I\u2019m optimistic, but I\u2019d say that everyone wants to get to a positive result.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, too, were clearly frustrated. Against long odds, Ryan had cobbled together enough votes for a one-month funding plan by promising the most conservatives lawmakers a vote on a hardline immigration plan that has little chance of clearing the House, let alone find support in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe do some crazy things in Washington but this is utter madness,\u201d the Speaker said, brimming with frustration. He later sent that observation to his email list.\n\nIt echoed McConnell\u2019s pre-shutdown pique. Even as the government was hurtling toward running out of cash, the top Republican in the Senate said he wasn\u2019t sure what it would take to get the the President\u2019s sign-off. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something that President Trump supports,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not yet indicated what measure he\u2019s willing to sign.\u201d\n\nIn fact, some in the President\u2019s negotiating team told lawmakers to pitch a Homeland Security outline of immigration demands. Hardliners inside the White House said the list was incomplete, and the President seemed to side with them. That effectively undercut Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a close Kelly ally, and sent everyone back into a chaos so familiar after a year of the Trump presidency.\n\nThat left many White House aides and their Republican counterparts on the brink of rage and undercutting each other in meetings. \u201cHow do we win against Congress if we can\u2019t even agree among ourselves? We can\u2019t even figure out what a win looks like,\u201d a frustrated White House staffer said. \u201cNo one here knows how this ends.\u201d", "title": "The People Who Started the Shutdown Don\u2019t Know How to End It", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5111513/shutdown-day-two-congress/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T02:48:30Z"}, {"textData": "Photo\n\nThe leader of the Hawaii National Guard told state lawmakers on Friday that he informed the governor that a panic-inducing missile alert was a false alarm two minutes after it had been sent to cellphones statewide.\n\nThe leader, Maj.

Think of it as a sort of congressional mission statement, meant to ensure that the process is not driven solely by executive branch priorities. The resolution is then supposed to be followed by a series of spending bills, hashed out in congressional committees, by the beginning of the government\u2019s fiscal year, which was set in October.\n\nBut in the 1990s, after decades of Congress being mostly controlled by Democrats, Republicans took power, and in the process upended the long-held assumption that Democrats would almost always be in charge. This changed the political incentive structure for both parties. The old model assumed that the main point of conflict was between two branches of government, Congress and the White House, and thus rewarded collaboration and legislative trading between parties.\n\nBut with the possibility that Congress could change hands more often, the new incentive was to use the budget process as a tool of partisan skirmishing that would make it easier to retain or regain control of the legislature. Instead of negotiating to achieve policy goals while maintaining a unified front against the executive, Congress was at war with itself.\n\nA result is that Congress hasn\u2019t completed the entire budget process, with all the spending bills, on time in more than 20 years. Many years, it has not passed any budget resolution at all. This is perhaps the most basic responsibility of the legislative branch, yet for decades, Congress has repeatedly come up short.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Republicans talked about changing this. Senator Mitch McConnell promised that he would pass a budget every year if and when Republicans gained a Senate majority. But in 2016 there was no budget resolution at all, which led us to the unusual situation we saw last year, where there were two budget resolutions, one to set up the failed Republican health care bill and another, later in the year, to set up tax reform.\n\nThat Congress can fail to pass a budget with so little consequence \u2014 if anything, it boosted Republicans, by giving them two opportunities to try major partisan legislation \u2014 shows what a cynical charade the process has become. The eventual budget resolutions that were passed reveal how disconnected the process has become from actual budgetary considerations. The Republican resolution a year ago was what\u2019s known as a \u201cshell budget\u201d \u2014 essentially just a set of instructions that would have allowed the health care bill to be passed with a simple majority vote.\n\nThe health care bill, whatever its merits, was not a budget, or a central component of anyone\u2019s conception of what a budget should be. But that\u2019s what the budget resolution was used for. And that is, in many ways, the problem: The budget process is not really about budgeting anymore.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn other years, the budget process has become bogged down, and Congress has kept the government funded through temporary extensions known as continuing resolutions (C.R.s) that fund government operations based on current levels, or rolled everything into an omnibus \u2014 or in some cases, a \u201cCRomnibus,\u201d combining a budget omnibus bill and a continuing resolution. It\u2019s kludgy language to describe a kludgy process.\n\nThe reliance on an ad hoc system of budgeting has made it even more difficult for Congress to keep the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order. The continuing resolution passed by the House this week would have added about $30 billion to the national debt.\n\nThe stalemates that have come to define the budget process have helped set the stage for repeated shutdown showdowns. It is a broken process that has enabled and empowered partisan bad faith by setting up a situation in which everything is riding on a few enormous bills. So lawmakers try to hook other priorities \u2014 immigration, say, or health care \u2014 to \u201cmust pass\u201d legislation in hopes of using the leverage to push them through.\n\nFrom a purely tactical perspective, pursuing political objectives to the point of a shutdown is rarely an effective strategy. The last government shutdown, in 2013, grew out of Republican opposition to Obamacare, which at the time was an unpopular program. The shutdown started on the same day the health law\u2019s insurance exchanges opened, and crashed \u2014 but during the few weeks the government was closed, Obamacare actually grew more popular. I am highly sympathetic to the plight of the Dreamers who have become central to the current fight, but I would not be surprised if this shutdown goes for Democrats the way the last one did for Republicans.\n\nAs long as the current system remains in place, and partisan volatility remains high, these showdowns are likely to recur. There are, however, a variety of options for reform, ranging from small tweaks to total overhauls.\n\nJames Capretta of the American Enterprise Institute has proposed forcing the White House to be more involved in the process by making the budget resolution a law signed by the president, thus encouraging cross-branch negotiation. Another possibility raised by Molly Reynolds of the Brookings Institution would be to find ways to limit legislative attachments that are mostly meant to make the other party look bad. Moving to a two-year budget process might ease annual pressures. Or, per Yuval Levin, the editor of National Affairs, a ground-up reimagining of the process might be in order.\n\nReforms won\u2019t be easy under the best of circumstances. And the blame game now playing out in Washington shows that the shutdown itself has become a vehicle for partisan point scoring. The first step toward fixing the system is for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to decide that their priority is to fulfill essential governing responsibilities \u2014 and stop treating the shutdown as a game to be won.", "title": "Op-Ed Contributor: The Shutdown Shows the Twisted Rules of a Broken Congress", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/opinion/shutdown-broken-congress-budget.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T02:17:22Z"}, {"textData": "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 6.3 earthquake has struck northern Chile.\n\nThe quake, which was deep at 110 kilometers (68 miles), struck at 10:06 p.m. local time Saturday.

Later Sunday, wearing a dark winter coat and fur scarf and with half her hair tied to the back, she looked more serious with an expressionless face.\n\nHyon\u2019s arrival came hours after the International Olympic Committee allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the Olympics in exceptional entries given to the North. Among the 22 are 12 women who will join South Korea\u2019s female hockey team in the Koreas\u2019 first-ever unified Olympic team. The other sports events the North Koreans will compete in are figure skating, short track speed skating, Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe 22 North Korean athletes will march together with South Korean players under a single \u201cunification flag\u201d depicting their peninsula during the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang. \u201cSuch an agreement would have seemed impossible only a few weeks ago,\u201d IOC chief Thomas Bach said in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe current mood of reconciliation between the Koreas flared after Kim abruptly expressed his willingness to improve ties and send a delegation to the Olympics during his annual New Year\u2019s address. Outside critics dismissed Kim\u2019s overture as a tactic to use improved ties with Seoul to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions over North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear and missile programs.\n\nHyon, who is also an alternate member of the ruling party\u2019s Central Committee, is travelling with six other North Koreans. Her delegation had been expected in South Korea on Saturday, but North Korea canceled that plan on Friday night before it proposed a two-day trip starting Sunday. It wasn\u2019t clear why the visit was rescheduled.\n\nHyon\u2019s advance team is to inspect a venue for her art troupe\u2019s performance in Gangnenug later Sunday. The team is expected to stay overnight at Gangneung before returning to Seoul to check another venue in the capital on Monday, according to Yonhap news agency.\n\nThe Samjiyon art troupe, which comprises orchestra members, singers and dancers, is part of North Korea\u2019s Olympic delegation that also includes athletes, officials, journalists and a taekwondo demonstration team.\n\nNorth Korea on Sunday offered to send another advance team across the border on Thursday to look at accommodation facilities, a press center and the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies, according to Seoul\u2019s Unification Ministry. South Korea is to send its own advance team to North Korea on Tuesday to review logistics for a joint cultural event at the North\u2019s Diamond Mountain and their non-Olympic skiers\u2019 joint practices at the North\u2019s Masik ski resort, the ministry said.\n\nHyon was a popular singer before she was appointed to lead the Moranbong Band, which serves as the \u201csoft\u201d public face of the Kim government. Its members in short skirts and high heels or stylish military uniforms sing and dance odes to Kim. There is speculation that some of the Moranbong members may also appear in the Samjiyon art troupe, which observers say was likely hastily formed ahead of Olympics-related talks with South Korea.\n\nUnder a deal with South Korea, the Samjiyon group is to play folk songs and classic masterpieces that are well-known to both Koreas and fit in with the theme of unification. An attempt by the group to perform any propaganda piece would trigger protests from conservatives in South Korea. The Moranbong Band canceled its planned 2015 performance in Beijing at the last minutes after Beijing wanted to replace a missile launch scene from the background of the stage, according to South Korea media.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In the Hollywood-inspired popular images of the 1950s, the great white hunter was a fearless Clark Gable or Stewart Granger, tall and deeply tanned, who brought down a charging rhino with a single shot while his arrogant client cowered behind him, and who later romanced the client\u2019s neglected wife after saving her from a snarling lion.\n\nThe reality was Mr. Selby: short and stocky, mild and self-effacing, a man who seemed to listen with his eyes. He had curly hair, a boyishly shy smile and a wife and two children. He catered to men used to giving orders, not taking them, but did it with tact, avoiding upbraiding a client needlessly and almost never finding it necessary to save anyone. Neither he nor any client was ever seriously injured on a safari, though there were some close calls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was not all shooting and campfire tales. A Selby safari required an army of bearers, cooks, skinners, porters, drivers and others; game licenses and financial transactions; transportation arrangements, from trucks and horses to planes and boats; and a complex coordination of supplies and equipment: guns and ammunition, food, water, tents, cots, radios, medicines, maps, clothing and a thousand other necessities.\n\nWithout cellphones or evacuation helicopters, Mr. Selby had to be the doctor, mechanic, chauffeur, gin-rummy-and-drinking partner and universal guide, knowledgeable about mountain ranges, grassy plains, rivers, jungles, hunting laws, migratory patterns, and the Bushmen, Masai, Samburu, Dinka and Zulu tribes. He spoke three dialects of Swahili. And he improvised; if there was no firewood, he burned wildebeest dung.\n\nHe was no Gregory Peck, but had an easygoing personality that made for good company in the bush. He coped with emergencies, pulling a client clear of a stampede or a vehicle from a bog, treating snakebites or tracking a wounded lion in a thicket \u2014 his most dangerous game. He was left-handed, but his favorite gun was a right-handed .416 Rigby, which can knock down an onrushing bull elephant or Cape buffalo in a thundering instant.\n\nSafaris changed dramatically in his time. In Kenya and Tanganyika in the late 1940s and \u201950s, he took parties hundreds of miles into trackless bush country by truck, pitched camps with comfortable though primitive amenities, drank gin by kerosene lamp, and pursued game by his own instincts. Safaris lasted two or three months. The showers were often cold, but the food was good and the game plentiful.\n\nIn his later years in Botswana, safaris went out for just a few weeks and focused as much, if not more, on photography as on hunting, although Mr. Selby preferred hunters. Photography buffs stayed in hotel-like lodges and went on day trips to scenic sites. More adventurous hunters and photographers were flown to rendezvous points and driven in Land Rovers to fixed camps elaborately equipped with electric power, refrigerators, flush toilets, hot showers, kitchens and dining facilities with silverware and table linen.\n\n\u201cAfrica itself has changed out of all recognition, both physically and politically, and the old-time self-contained safari would have no place to go in today\u2019s Africa,\u201d Mr. Selby wrote for Sports Afield in 2010, when satellite phones, computers and helicopters made life easy for the busy executive on safari.\n\n\u201cThere are hunters today,\u201d he added, \u201cwho would prefer to have experienced the sense of freedom of an old-time safari, as I am sure there were those who went on safari many years ago who would have preferred something along the lines of what is offered today. The two experiences are as different as night is from day; the only feature common to both is the name \u2026 that magical word, \u2018safari.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohn Henry Selby \u2014 Harry was his universal nickname \u2014 was born in Frankfort, South Africa, on July 22, 1925, the youngest of six children of Arthur and Myrtle Evelyn Randall Selby. When he was 3, his family moved to a 40,000-acre cattle ranch near Mount Kenya.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSurrounded by a game-rich countryside, the boy learned to hunt from an old Kikuyu tribesman. \u201cHe taught me to use my eyes and ears as well as my nose, and to be patient in order to remain motionless for long periods of time waiting for an animal to come within range,\u201d Mr. Selby told The American Rifleman.\n\nMr. Selby attended local schools, traveling by ox cart, and later the Prince of Wales, a boarding school in Nairobi. After World War II, he worked for Mr. Percival, who recognized his potential as a hunter-guide, and in 1949 he joined East Africa\u2019s foremost safari outfitter, Ker & Downey, based in Nairobi. In 1956, after Mr. Ruark\u2019s book had made him famous, he formed his own safari company, Selby & Holmberg.\n\nIn 1953, he married Maria Elizabeth Clulow, known as Miki. They had two children, Mark and Gail. Mark died in 2017. Mr. Selby is survived by his wife, daughter and a number of grandchildren.\n\nIn 1962, after Kenyan independence and political upheavals dimmed prospects for safaris in East Africa, he accepted a partnership in his old company, which became Ker, Downey and Selby, and in 1963 moved as its trailblazer to Bechuanaland, a British protectorate that became independent Botswana in 1966. It was a hunter\u2019s \u2014 and a photographer\u2019s \u2014 paradise.\n\n\u201cWhat we found exceeded our wildest expectations \u2014 a land which the passage of time had passed by, where nature had remained unchanged in the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Selby said in an interview for this obituary. \u201cThe vast savannas were teeming with huge herds of elephant, buffalo, kudu, zebra, wildebeest and sable. Lions were everywhere, showing little fear of man.\u201d\n\nFor 30 years, Mr. Selby ran company operations in Botswana, and guided hunters and photographers into leased concessions covering thousands of square miles in the Okavango Delta in the north and the vast Kalahari Desert in the south, home of the click-talking Bushmen. He cut tracks and built airfields in the wilderness.\n\nIn 1970, he established Botswana\u2019s first lodge and camps for photographic safaris. He hired guides and a large support staff for what became a dominant safari business in Southern Africa. After Ker, Downey and Selby was bought by Safari South in 1978, he remained a director, and even after resigning in 1993 he continued to lead safaris privately until retiring in 2000.\n\nIn 2007, President Festus Mogae of Botswana awarded Mr. Selby the Presidential Certificate of Honor in recognition of his contributions to hunting and photographic tourism.", "title": "Harry Selby, Renowned Hunter and Safari Guide, Is Dead at 92", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/obituaries/harry-selby-dead.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T23:46:47Z"}, {"textData": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is ordering an Ethics Committee investigation after the New York Times reports that U.S. Rep.

The ad, on the first anniversary of Trump's inauguration, was distributed to reporters in an email from Trump's campaign and purportedly featured scenes from the trial of an undocumented immigrant who was alleged to have killed two police officers in Sacramento.\n\n\u201cIt's pure evil,\u201d a narrator says. \u201cPresident Trump is right: build the wall, deport criminals, stop illegal immigration now. Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants. President Trump will fix our border and keep our families safe.\u201d\n\nTrump nixed a bipartisan Senate proposal that would have provided legal status to immigrants who came to the country illegally as children, known as \u201cdreamers,\u201d in exchange for a $1.6 billion down-payment on his push to build a wall on the southwest border with Mexico. The plan also would have made changes to the nation's legal immigration system.\n\nWithout the immigration deal, the Senate blocked a House bill that would have funded the government for four weeks, leading to the shutdown. A large majority of Democrats voted against the bill, along with a handful of Republicans.\n\nTrump has repeatedly sought to paint immigrants as dangerous, talking about transnational gangs, such as MS-13, and implementing a travel ban on travelers from some countries in the Middle East and Africa over what he said were concerns about terrorism.\n\nBut some studies have shown that immigrants, including those here illegally, commit crimes at lower rates than do native-born Americans.\n\n[Trump\u2019s claim that immigrants bring \u2018tremendous crime\u2019 is wrong]\n\nFor example, a March 2017 study by the pro-immigration Cato Institute found that \u201call immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than natives relative to their shares of the population\u201d and that \u201ceven illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post's Fact Checker reported in 2015, one study showed that between 1990 and 2013, \u201cthe foreign-born share of the U.S. population grew from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent and the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled from 3.5 million to 11.2 million.\n\n\u201cDuring the same period, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48 percent \u2014 which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41 percent, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary,\u201d according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nThe violent crime rate was cut nearly by half during a period in which unauthorized immigrants tripled, according to the council.\n\nSalvador Rizzo contributed to this report.", "title": "In campaign ad, Trump says Democrats \u2018complicit\u2019 in crimes by immigrants", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/20/in-campaign-ad-trump-says-democrats-complicit-in-crimes-by-immigrants/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T23:26:07Z"}, {"textData": "\n\nBoonchai Bach, left, an alleged kingpin in Asia\u2019s illegal trade in endangered species, was arrested by Thai police in Bangkok on Friday. (Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThai police have arrested a Vietnamese national who they say ran an international network that trafficked massive quantities of elephant ivory, rhino horn and wildlife, threatening the existence of already endangered species in Asia and Africa for years.\n\nBoonchai Bach, 40, was arrested Friday in Nakhon Phanom, a northeastern Thailand province that borders Laos, in connection to the illegal trafficking of 14 African rhino horns to Thailand in December, according to the Freeland Foundation, an anti-trafficking group that\u2019s been tracking Boonchai and his family for years. The case, which involved $1 million worth of rhino horns, also implicated a Thai official, a Chinese smuggler and a Vietnamese courier, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cThis arrest is significant for many reasons. The confiscated items are high in value. And we are able to arrest the whole network involved, starting from the courier, the facilitator, the exporter,\" who planned to move the goods through the Thai-Laos border, Thai Police Col. Chutrakul Yodmadee said.\n\nBoonchai has denied the allegations against him.\n\nThai authorities have been investigating his family for years. They zeroed in on Boonchai in December, when Thai customs officials found concealed rhino horns in cargo on a flight from Ethiopia. The flight was carrying Vietnamese and Chinese passengers, which raised suspicions among customs officials, according to the Freeland Foundation. A Thai airport official was later arrested and admitted to working with a Chinese smuggler and a relative of Boonchai. The three are being held in a Thai prison.\n\n[Ivory sales in China finally end this month. But elephants aren\u2019t yet safe.]\n\nFreeland Foundation said new evidence led to Boonchai\u2019s arrest this week.\n\n\u201cThe arrest spells hope for wildlife. We hope Thailand, its neighboring countries and counterparts in Africa will build on this arrest and tear Hydra completely apart,\u201d the group\u2019s founder, Steven Galster, said, referring to a network of suppliers and buyers across Asia.\n\nThe Bach family, with Boonchai as the kingpin, led the illegal trafficking of exotic Asian and African wildlife, including elephant ivory, rhino horns, pangolins, tigers, lions and other endangered species, to major dealers in Laos, Vietnam and China, according to the Freeland Foundation. Authorities also believe the Bachs were the main supplier of Vixay Keosavang, a Laotian wildlife dealer dubbed the \u201cPablo Escobar of wildlife trafficking\u201d in a 2013 New York Times story.\n\n\n\nThai customs officials display seized ivory during a news conference in Bangkok on Jan. 12.

(Sakchai Lalit/Associated Press)\n\nAccording to authorities, the original leader of the Bach family\u2019s trafficking ring was Bach Van Lim, Boonchai\u2019s older brother. In 2005, he passed on some of his authority to Boonchai, who operated headquarters in Nakhon Phanom. Contraband was brought from there to Laos through the nearby Mekong River and was transported to Vietnam and China, the Freeland Foundation said.\n\nBoonchai could face up to four years in prison and a fine of 40,000 baht ($1,300), the AP reported. Authorities also could charge him with money laundering and customs violation, crimes that could add a sentence of up to 10 more years.\n\nThai police have been cracking down on the country\u2019s ivory trade for years. Officials announced in July that they have seized more than 400 elephant tusks and fragments in a single case.\n\n[Trump puts hold on this week's decision to again allow trophies from elephant hunts in Zimbabwe]\n\n\u201cWe have made serious efforts to block elephant ivory from being smuggled into the country and sent to another country. . . . If we block ivory from being smuggled out of the country, then we will destroy it. We have been able to effectively arrest more and more suspects with tangible results,\u201d Deputy Police Commissioner Gen. Chalermkiat Sriworakhan said in July, according to the AP.\n\nThai authorities also had frozen $37 million in assets linked to the trafficking of tigers in the northeast of Thailand. In 2016, authorities seized bank accounts and assets of a Thai national who was convicted of trafficking rhino horns in South Africa.\n\nDays before Boonchai\u2019s arrest, Thai authorities seized 326 pounds of African elephant ivory, including three large tusks, worth around $469,800 from a Bangkok airport.\n\nIvory, which comes from elephants\u2019 tusks, is used as jewelry, ornaments, medicine, chopsticks and others. Markets in the United States and Asia, particularly in China, fueled demand, according to a 2015 international study conducted by National Geographic, and that resulted in the death of about 30,000 elephants every year.\n\nLast spring, China shut down dozens of its licensed ivory facilities, a move that some see as a sign that the country intends to help put an end to the ivory trade.\n\nIn November, the Trump administration announced it will reverse an Obama-era ban on importation of elephant-hunt trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia. President Trump later decided to keep the ban in place, at least for now, following protests from animal rights groups.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe horn and ivory trade\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service said we have to kill elephants to help save them.
