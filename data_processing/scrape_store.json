Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a veteran of the immigration wars who favors comprehensive reform, was also surprised that the cause of Dreamers had prompted such a partisan battle. Flake and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) spent much of Saturday cloistered with Senate leaders and other rank-and-file senators, trying to carve out a path to not only re-open the government but somehow move a deal to enshrine the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals Program, or DACA.\nFlake recalled that in previous immigration negotiations, finding legal status for Dreamers was always the easier part of the discussions and that piece was used to help move other, more controversial changes to immigration laws. \n\u201cThis is a sympathetic group. We knew it could move on its own,\u201d Flake said. \u201cNow on its own, it\u2019s the reason we\u2019re shutting down the government.\u201d \nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top negotiator on immigration for Senate Democrats, said for now, he wasn\u2019t concerned that the ugly shutdown battle would end up hurting the prospects of a bipartisan immigration deal. \n\u201cBut the sooner we get beyond this, the better,\u201d Durbin added. \u201cThe longer it goes, the worse it gets.\u201d \nThere are tangible consequences of a protracted shutdown when it comes to negotiations. For one, the White House has flatly refused to negotiate on immigration while the federal government\u2019s doors are closed.\n\n\n\n            By JOHN BRESNAHAN\nThe primary team tapped with brokering an immigration deal \u2014 the No. 2 leaders in each chamber, along with top administration officials \u2014 haven\u2019t met since a Friday morning session that the Democratic whips did not attend.\nAt that Friday meeting, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) stressed that there would be no reason for the leaders to continue the discussion as long as Democrats threatened to reject bills that would stave off a government shutdown, according to a source familiar with the conversation. \n\u201cNow that they have, I don\u2019t expect it to get rescheduled until they reopen the government,\u201d the person said. \nIt's baffling to many on Capitol Hill that a broadly popular initiative such as protecting Dreamers could trigger a shutdown. A CNN poll released Friday showed the DACA program is almost universally popular: 84 percent of those surveyed said they would like to see it continue. \n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me the Democratic Party\u2019s willing to do something on DACA. What\u2019s equally clear to me is that an overwhelming number of Republicans will be fair to the DACA population,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cWhich just blows my mind. As Mitch [McConnell] said, how could this happen? How could you take an 80 percent issue and screw it up?\u201d\nThe popularity of the DACA program, however, changes when tied to the shutdown. \nThe CNN poll also found that 56 percent of voters said averting a shutdown was more important than continuing the DACA program, while 34 percent favored DACA. Democrats and advocates were dismissive of the poll\u2019s findings, arguing that it set up a false choice when both outcomes were simultaneously plausible. \n\n\nSome advocates believe the administration\u2019s scorched-earth rhetorical campaign against Dreamers won't do much damage in the long run. \n\u201cAre Dreamers going to be somehow less popular? That number has gradually gone up over the last five, 10 years,\u201d one advocate said. \u201cEven if you lost 20 percent of Republicans, you\u2019d lose 4-5 percent with the public.\u201d \nBefore agreeing to any stopgap funding of more than a few days, Democrats are insisting on a path forward for an immigration deal through both chambers of Congress. Advocates say there is no path unless an immigration fix is tied to a must-pass bill like a spending measure. \nThat\u2019s a nonstarter for Republicans. But for advocates, the showdown is worth it. \n\u201cWe were being slow walked to death,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the executive director of the immigration advocacy group America\u2019s Voice. \u201cThe Republican strategy, the McConnell-Ryan strategy, was to isolate the DACA fix [from] the spending negotiations so that it would be delayed and derailed.\u201d\n\n                                            By Janine di Giovanni\n\n                                            By Dan Diamond\n\n                                            By Jeff Greenfield\n\n                                            By Gordon F.

He said the conflict could only be resolved through negotiations leading to a two-state solution.\n\nIsrael views Jerusalem as its unified capital, while the Palestinians demand east Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their future state. A longstanding international consensus holds that the city's final status should be decided through negotiations, which was also U.S. policy going back decades.\n\nArab and Muslim nations support the Palestinians' claim to east Jerusalem, and the Trump administration's shift ignited protests across the region.\n\nAhead of Pence's arrival, several dozen Jordanians gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Amman, protesting against U.S. policies in the Middle East.\n\n\"America is the head of the snake,\" they chanted.

There, Abbas is expected to urge EU member states to recognize a state of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, lands captured by Israel in 1967, and to step up involvement in mediation.\n\nNabil Abu Rdeneh, an Abbas adviser, reiterated Sunday that \"the U.S. is no longer acceptable as a mediator.\"\n\n\"Any plan from any side should be based on the basic references, which are the U.N. resolutions on the establishment of a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with east Jerusalem as a capital, and the Arab Peace Initiative, which addresses many issues, including the issue of refugees,\" he said.\n\n\"Any plan that is not based on the international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative will not be acceptable, neither by the Palestinians nor the Arabs.\"\n\nPence was also expected to meet with U.S. troops in the region on Sunday and then depart for Israel, where he's scheduled to hold meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, deliver an address to the Knesset and visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nNetanyahu has said he'll soon decide on Israel's new ambassador to Jordan after the two countries agreed to move past a diplomatic row. Israel media reported Netanyahu as saying Israel had expressed remorse over a shooting at its Amman embassy last summer that killed two Jordanians.\n\nIsrael's ambassador returned to Israel along with the guard involved in the shooting. The guard claimed self-defense and received a hero's welcome at home, angering Jordanians.\n\nThe incident has strained relations between the countries, which signed a peace agreement in 1994 and cooperate on security and other issues.", "title": "Pence meets Jordan king on trip clouded by Jerusalem move", "sourceId": "cnbc", "sourceName": "CNBC", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/21/pence-meets-jordan-king-on-trip-clouded-by-jerusalem-move.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T11:37:00Z"}, {"textData": "\n\n\nA Turkish media report says Turkish troops conducting military operations in Turkey's southeast have been hit by an avalanche.\n\nThe Dogan news agency says at least two soldiers were killed and seven others were injured in the avalanche that occurred Sunday near the town of Hizan in southeastern Turkey's mountainous Bitlis province.\n\nThe agency said the soldiers were conducting operations against Kurdish rebel group the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK.\n\nThe report said three soldiers were missing in the avalanche.\n\nOfficials were not immediately available to comment.", "title": "Report: Avalanche kills 2 soldiers, injures 7 in Turkey", "sourceId": "abc-news", "sourceName": "ABC News", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/report-avalanche-kills-soldiers-injures-turkey-52499517", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T11:36:12Z"}, {"textData": "\n\n\nAn island volcano in Papua New Guinea erupted again Sunday, sending plumes of steam and ash into the air.\n\nThousands of people have been evacuated from islands surrounding Kadovar Island off the South Pacific nation's north coast since the volcano there began erupting on Jan. 5.

These moments, usually in the first half of a career, come when a reporter or editor is immersed in a story that at the time is all-consuming\u2014as though history suddenly has revved its jets\u2014and remains a frame of reference even years later.\nIt is just our luck that for many Washington journalists of my generation one of those career-defining stories revolved around furtive acts of West Wing fellatio.\nStory Continued Below\nSure, go ahead and snicker. Even at the time, the scandal involving Bill Clinton\u2019s illicit relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky that broke publicly on this day twenty years ago\u2014January 21, 1998\u2014was the inspiration for no end of lewd jokes and chortling.\nWhat many people don\u2019t remember\u2014and what people who are too young to have followed the story in real time may find inconceivable\u2014was how strange and disturbing and fragile things seemed at the beginning.\n And they may not perceive what seems clear to many veterans of those days: How much the angry, raucous, media-saturated politics of the Age of Trump has its roots in the angry, raucous media-saturated politics of the Age of Clinton.\nIn the opening days after the Washington Post and Newsweek broke the news that independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s years-long investigation into Clinton\u2019s financial affairs was now focused on his sexual affairs there was widespread speculation that a presidential resignation might be days away.\nWithin several weeks, however, it became evident that even as the sex scandal was at least briefly an object of prurient obsession for nearly everyone, only for some people\u2014well short of a majority\u2014was it an object of moral indignation and constitutional gravity. Jay Leno cracked on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d that Clinton was doing so well in the polls that he was already planning his next sex scandal.\nThat quip captured the prevailing view of Clinton\u2019s sex scandal that took hold long before Clinton reversed his emphatic denials of an affair with Lewinsky (in August 1998) and the Senate acquitted him (in February 1999) in an impeachment trial in which the outcome was never in doubt. In this light, the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal was the kind of story that could only flourish outside the main currents of history\u2014after the end of the Cold War but before the September 11, 2001 attacks jolted us from our national slumber.\n***\nOn its 20th anniversary, however, those surreal days of January 1998 seem connected in a much more linear and living way to the politics of 2018.\nIt was the first time as a journalist I experienced political events at close range and thought, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening\u2014it feels like a hallucination.\u201d In the Trump era, I (and many others) have these moments several times a week. \n \u201cPresent at the Creation,\u201d was Dean Acheson\u2019s title of his memoir of the early days of the Cold War. Those of us immersed in the Clinton story sometimes perceive we were present at the destruction. In this case, the destruction of confidence that the game of politics was on the level or that people with respected titles, like president or senator or lawyer or anchorman, were necessarily comporting themselves in respectable or responsible ways.\nClinton survived his scandal not so much because people believed his finger-wagging assertion, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman\u201d\u2014then a faint pause as he seemed to blank on her name\u2014\u201cMs. Lewinsky.\u201d He survived because he persuaded a majority that the scandal was not about sex (as most people at first naturally assumed) nor about the rule of law (as Republicans primly insisted was their real concern). It was about power. And in power battles the question that matters most is not, \u201cWhat is the truth?\u201d It is instead: \u201cWhat side are you on?\u201d\n\n                            Clockwise, from upper left: President Clinton during a White House press conference, April 30, 1998; Monica Lewinsky and her attorney William Ginsburg leave a Washington restaurant, Feb. 21, 1998; Independent counsel Kenneth Starr holds a copy of his report during congressional testimony, Nov. 19, 1998; Linda Tripp speaks to reporters in front of a federal courthouse, July 29, 1998. | AP Photos\nTo mark the anniversary of the Clinton-Lewinsky moment, POLITICO\u2014which was still nine years away from launch when the scandal broke\u2014assembled a group of journalists who had played central roles in the story to ponder the lessons of that history. The conversation is excerpted below.\nMichael Isikoff, then a Newsweek reporter and now with Yahoo News, was the reporter who first learned about the connection between Lewinsky and Clinton and the fact that Starr was investigating. Newsweek editors wanted more time to deliberate whether to publish, meaning Isikoff got partially scooped on his scoop when Matt Drudge used his platform on the then-new Internet to publicize the big battle taking place inside the magazine. \u201cThose few days were as gripping and nerve-wracking as any I have experienced,\u201d he said.\nHe predicted that Washington will again see an impeachment battle after what he sees as the probability that control of the House of Representatives flips to Democrats in the 2018 elections. \nIskioff also asserts that recent events has vindicated his old reporting. Back then, Clinton loyalists attacked his professionalism by suggesting he was a sex-obsessed reporter on the \u201cbimbo beat.\u201d What he was really exploring, he said, was the way important people use their power to exploit women\u2014as highlighted by the Harvey Weinstein scandal.\nIt is just a fact that there is no reasonable way---under the new prevailing standards around sexual harassment--that Bill Clinton could pass a test that Al Franken or Charlie Rose or Kevin Spacey failed. Of course, as many have noted, it is hard to see how Donald Trump passes such a test either.\nSusan Glasser, now a global affairs columnist for POLITICO and then the editor shepherding scandal coverage for the Washington Post, argued that Trump learned a very specific lesson from Clinton: Don\u2019t let the truth get in the way of politics.\n\u201cI believe that Donald Trump has learned from and will take to heart the lessons of how Clinton survived politically the year 1998,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was political genius how he handled it by lying. Lying was proven to work in some way that has enabled further the cynical and divisive political culture of Washington.\u201d\nTrump learned a very specific lesson from Clinton: Don\u2019t let the truth get in the way of politics.\u201d\nGlasser also wonders the same thing I do: How is that a story that would have been jaw-dropping\u2014and quickly all-consuming for the news media--in the Clinton years seems to be moving swiftly to the margins of Trump coverage. This was the revelation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, that a few weeks before the 2016 election secretly paid a pornographic actress, who then recanted her previous claim that they had a sexual relationship a decade earlier. \nWhy has this has not produced a 1998 style feeding frenzy? And don\u2019t responsible editors have an obligation to press on this story?\nPeter Baker, then the White House reporter for the Washington Post and (amazingly) still on the beat 20 years later for the New York Times, reminded the group that lots of Democrats in 1998 were none too fond of Bill Clinton, in the same way that many Republicans in 1974 were appalled by Richard Nixon. But Clinton used the modern political and media culture to ensure that his own party did not turn on him. In the same way that Trump has so far kept his own party\u2014which includes many leaders who loathe him\u2014from turning on him.\n \u201cOne of the things that Clinton did that helped ensure his survival is to make sure, A) he made it partisan, and, B) he took advantage of the partisanship of his opponents. Right? You\u2019ve talked about the opponents\u2019 overreach helping him out. By making it a partisan thing, he forced Democrats who didn\u2019t approve of his behavior [and] who might have abandoned him under other circumstances to stand by him because they didn\u2019t want\u2026..to stand with the other guys, \u201c Baker said. \u201cThat has only gotten more so in 20 years by virtue of the media and social media and the increasingly balkanized, polarized environment in which we live in. Everything is seen through the partisan lens, and it\u2019s so hard to kind of get to that Nixonian era where basically Republicans were able to say, \u2018Enough. We don\u2019t believe that this president belongs here even though he\u2019s from our own party.\u2019\u201d\nIf there was one common belief among the panel we assembled it was in the redemptive power of conscientious and politically independent reporting. But a chastening note came later from someone the panelist all know\u2014Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel--who wasn\u2019t on the panel but whom I spoke with later.\nEmanuel was then by Clinton\u2019s side as a White House senior adviser. During that year of partisanship and frenzy, he said, was the first time he noticed non-journalistic voices like the Daily show having as much power\u2014and in some ways more power\u2014than traditional media in setting the agenda and creating the prism through which politics is viewed. \u201cYou guys lost,\u201d he said, without a tone of gloating\u2026.[Establishment] people and institutions lost authority and public support and that includes the media.\u201d\nThat is an argument that Trump definitely believes. And, if true, one that he benefits from.\n***\nThe following transcript has been edited for length and readability. Listen to the full conversation here.\nJohn Harris: Twenty years ago this week, the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks wide open, and for a certain group of us, it was a defining moment in our careers covering Washington. Mention her name to my children, who [in 1998] were not yet born, and it prompts snickers. Those snickers and eye rolls\u2014many people have those now when they think of that scandal. I\u2019m trying to invite people to remember that in those opening days, it did not prompt laughter, it seemed really serious. The issues raised about the presidency, about the media, seemed\u2014then and even now\u2014seem profound. \nPeter Baker: I actually think we\u2019re kind of coming full circle back to that. The whole \u201cMe Too\u201d thing in the last few months has put this back on the table in a way that doesn\u2019t sound quite as snickering. After 9/11, a lot of people said, \u201cOh, look what they spent their time on in the \u201990s instead of focusing on real threats.\u201d And, \u201cOh, gosh. That was just a case of sexual McCarthyism gone amuck.\u201d And I think today it looks a little different.\nWe\u2019re revisiting in some ways what President Clinton did and what he was accused of in the light of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and all these others. And you hear some of the people who defended him\u2014including people like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand\u2014saying, \u201cWell, maybe actually we shouldn\u2019t have handled it the way we should have. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t have defended him.\u201d\nSusan Glasser: I think the comparisons that are echoing for people right now are, as Peter correctly pointed out, the #MeToo movement in Washington and the sense that the world has changed and that what seemed an acceptable level of sort of sexual peccadillos on the part of the president is actually something much more predatory and disturbing. But it\u2019s also about institutions. Trump poses these big questions about the nature of the presidency, what our expectations are for the office, what is the proper role of Congress or the media when the presidency seems to be out of balance in some way. And, of course, that is instantly what people recognized as the potential problems and threats when the Monica Lewinsky story first broke. That was the question we were instantly confronted with that people forget. It wasn\u2019t so much, \u201cDid he or didn\u2019t he do it with Monica Lewinsky?,\u201d although that was certainly relevant right away. It was also the question of, \u201cWhat are we supposed to do when the president lies under oath, or he was accused instantly of suborning perjury?\u201d\n\n                            Monica Lewinsky embraces President Clinton as he greets well-wishers in Washington, Nov. 6, 1996. | AP Photo\nHarris: Michael, take us back though that moment. Nobody was closer to the story than you.\nMichael Isikoff: Oh, my God. It was crazy. I had, through a weird set of circumstances, been aware of the Lewinsky relationship with Clinton for months. I had been talking to Linda Tripp. She had been telling me everything \u2026 the late-night phone calls and surreptitious visits. At one point, she offered to give me the blue dress. So I was aware this was a potentially big story. We would talk about it at Newsweek: How would we ever publish this? How would we ever be able to prove that this was real? Then I get the phone call on a Tuesday. There is this little event going on at the Ritz-Carlton: Tripp is having lunch with Monica, and [Whitewater independent counsel Ken] Starr\u2019s got the whole thing wired. And I nearly fell off my chair. Starr? Ken Starr is on this?\nBaker: Well, that\u2019s what makes it different: It\u2019s not a sex scandal at this point; it\u2019s the prosecutor who is alleging criminal acts that go beyond infidelity.\nIsikoff: Absolutely. That\u2019s when I knew this was an earthquake. Washington was about to explode, because any way you cut it, this was going to be a monster story. Those few days 20 years ago were as gripping and nerve-racking as any I have experienced.\nThat\u2019s when I knew this was an earthquake. Washington was about to explode.\u201d\nHarris: Just to take people back, Peter and I both covered the White House [for the Washington Post] and Susan was our editor on many of the important stories. Before this, we, let\u2019s face it, would gossip all the time\u2014\u201cWhat about this rumor? What about that?\u201d\u2014as kind of a recreational habit to pass the hours on the press plane. But we would, for the most part, never think about injecting that into our stories or making it a major subject of coverage.\nGlasser: In part because of the politics before then. It\u2019s not that it was a taboo subject; it had been raised from the very beginning of Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, and he had won not once but twice despite this conversation about his extracurricular sex life. And I think there was a feeling that, politically speaking, it was out there and the judgment of the public had been heard on it.\nIsikoff: But the public didn\u2019t know what was true and what was not. Just as we all didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why you would talk about it and gossip about it. I got into this for a number of reasons, but one big reason was that I had helped in the Post\u2019s coverage of Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas. So when the Paula Jones allegations first surfaced, my perspective was, \u201cWell, if we took Anita Hill seriously, we have to take this seriously.\u201d And let\u2019s remember what the core allegations of Paula Jones were: that a state trooper summons her\u2014while she\u2019s on the job\u2014up to a hotel room to see the then-governor, who proceeds to make sexual advances, drops his pants, exposes himself and asks for oral sex. Now, who does that sound like when you hear it today? I think most people would think, \u201cOh, my God. Harvey Weinstein.\u201d That\u2019s what Paula Jones was alleging. So then the question became, \u201cWas she telling the truth?\u201d And I spent a lot of time on that. The Post went around and round about how to handle something like this. Yes, she had come forward [via Clinton\u2019s] political enemies, yet she had witnesses. The woman who was sitting next to her confirmed that the state trooper was there and took her down and she came down and appeared shaken as she left when she left the hotel room.\nWho does that sound like when you hear it today? I think most people would think, \u201cOh, my God. Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\nHarris: We used to torture ourselves: \u201cWell, what\u2019s the angle? Who paid for the state trooper\u2019s gas?\u201d So there was a public angle and we\u2019d have to look at it. The sex was, of course, nobody\u2019s business, but maybe the abuse of funds is. And now we would say, \u201cNo, sexual relations, as they reflect power relationships, are fair game.\u201d\n\n                            Monica Lewinsky appears on the cover of the Feb. 2, 1998, edition of Newsweek magazine. | AP Photo\nGlasser: I went back and [read] both the original, fascinating Newsweek story, which was written by Michael [Isikoff] and the original, fascinating Washington Post story, which was written by Peter [Baker], Sue Schmidt and Toni Locy. And I was really struck: There is a very antiquated and very sexist characterization of all of the women, in particular Monica Lewinsky, in those original stories. Questioning her veracity, her presentation\u2014everything about her was considered to be fair game, from how she dressed and her lack of maturity and her own penchant for talking about sex with Linda Tripp. There was a deep vein of skepticism that she could ever possibly be telling the truth about this sexual relationship with the president of the United States. What really struck me, reading those accounts 20 years later: Everything Monica Lewinsky said was true.\nIsikoff: I happened to be on Morning Joe the other day talking about this, and I was admonished because I slipped at one point and called it \u201cthe Lewinsky scandal.\u201d I was admonished, and deservedly so.\nBaker: [Monica Lewinsky] hates that, and she\u2019s right.\nIsikoff: This was a Clinton scandal; it was not a Lewinsky scandal.\nThis was a Clinton scandal; it was not a Lewinsky scandal.\u201d\nBaker: It was a tough story to write. Michael\u2019s editors were squeamish about it and weren\u2019t sure whether or not to go forward with it because we had never actually accused a sitting president of the United States of doing anything like this. Gennifer Flowers came out through a tabloid in a campaign setting; it was just different.\nI remember sitting in the office of [the Post\u2019s] national editor. By this point, we knew Michael had a story; we knew it had been spiked [by Newsweek\u2019s editors]. We had gotten the gist of it ourselves through our own reporting, and we were about to publish. And the question that was being asked was not, \u201cShould we publish?\u201d It was, \u201cWhat holes do we still have?\u201d And what strikes me is that here we are 20 years later, there\u2019s no way on Earth a story like that wouldn\u2019t be published by the first organization that got it. Newsweek did hesitate, understandably, for good reasons, because they wanted to responsible.\nIsikoff: [Hesitates] Yeah.\nBaker: I\u2019m not agreeing with that, I\u2019m on your side on that one.\nIsikoff: OK, good. Just to make that clear.\nBaker: I think that they were trying to sort through tough issues, and they made a wrong call.\nIsikoff: They were squeamish. One of the arguments that was raised is, \u201cWell, what if [Lewinsky] is just a fabulist? What if she is just making this all up, and we go put on the newsstands for a week that the president is being investigated for this relationship, and it turns out she is a complete flake?\u201d\nWe had lots of advantages over everybody else, but our biggest advantage is we did have the tape. We had listened to the tape that Friday night into the wee hours of the morning, parsing every word\u2014I remember we just went around and around. There wasn\u2019t the explicit confirmation that Clinton had told her to lie, which was the core basis for Starr getting involved. It was ambiguous. There is an exchange where he says, \u201cWell, has he told you to lie?\u201d \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t tell me to lie.\u201d \u201cDoes he expect you\u2019re going to tell the truth?\u201d \u201cWell, no.\u201d So what is it? I suspect that accurately reflects what actually happened, because Clinton, for all his recklessness and stupidity for getting himself involved in this situation, was smart in that sense.\nGlasser: You said you listened to the tapes on Friday. It was not until Saturday, which is actually 20 years ago today\u2014Saturday, January 17th, 1998\u2014that Clinton went to give his deposition in the Paula Jones case. And they had the information about Monica, and they asked him a series of questions. And Clinton up until that very moment \u2026 probably sitting in the room is when he realized the vulnerability.\nHarris: There\u2019s no way they\u2019re asking these questions if they don\u2019t know. \nIsikoff: But the Jones lawyers blew it.\nGlasser: That\u2019s right.\nThat\u2019s when the cover-up begins. It\u2019s when Clinton starts to realize he\u2019s going to have to lie even more in order to protect himself, that his secret is out.\u201d\nIsikoff: They relied on this tortured definition of sexual relations instead of asking specifically, you know\u2014\nGlasser: Specific questions. Had they said, \u201cDid you do it?\u201d\nBaker: Again out of a desire not to besmirch the presidency. This is a tough thing. You\u2019re asking people to say to the president of the United States, \u201cDid you do this particular act?\u201d\nGlasser: That\u2019s when the cover-up begins. It\u2019s when Clinton starts to realize he\u2019s going to have to lie even more in order to protect himself, that his secret is out.\n\n                            In videotaped testimony, President Clinton responds to a questions from Independent Counsel Ken Starr's team on Aug. 17, 1998. | AP Photos\nHarris: I\u2019m torn though. On one hand, I think we would agree: There is no way Bill Clinton could pass the test as it\u2019s prevailing currently against Senator Al Franken or against Charlie Rose, based on what we know of his behavior and the allegations against him\u2014not just from Monica Lewinsky but from a trail of other people on the record, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones. He\u2019d flunk the test. Except there is no way that Donald Trump could also pass that test, and yet he seems to pass it. What gives?\nIsikoff: Good question. My instant reaction would be there is so much else with Trump\u2014so many other questions that might even be larger\u2014that maybe this one doesn\u2019t get as much attention as it should.\nBaker: The other day on the front page of a couple of the papers is a story about the president\u2014the future president of the United States allegedly paying $130,000 to keep a porn star quiet about their affair.\nHarris: Three days later, and now it\u2019s, \u201cIn other news\u2026\u201d\nBaker: It wasn\u2019t even on a front page a second day because of Michael\u2019s reason: There are so many other things. Is he mentally fit? Is he saying racially inflammatory things? Oh, and is he paying off a porn star?\nGlasser: But let\u2019s also say that the deck is still stacked against women. There are no women executive editors at these newspapers making decisions about what\u2019s important. There is a sense that somehow [much] like Gennifer Flowers came up in 1992 but Clinton was elected anyways, that because the Access Hollywood tape came out, because these women\u201419 women came forward and accused Donald Trump of various kinds of sexual harassment or assault even before the election\u2014his claim and that of his supporters is basically, \u201cOld news,\u201d or, \u201cFake news.\u201d\nBaker: I would say one of the unfortunate lessons from the Clinton episode that some other politicians have internalized is that denial works, and in Clinton\u2019s case, lying works. For seven to eight months, he basically says to the American people, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky,\u201d and then he finally admits it in the grand jury in August 1998. But by that point, the public was tired and sick of it, and they\u2019d already made up their own minds about it, and it wasn\u2019t as shocking. Had the admission come from the very beginning, it might have shocked the public enough to force him to resign. But he gave his supporters something to hold onto: \u201cIt\u2019s not true. It\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s Ken Starr.\u201d\nHarris: The delay allowed him to change the question from, \u201cDid he do it? Is that OK?,\u201d where I think a lot of people would have said \u201cNo, it\u2019s not OK.\u201d The question was not, \u201cDid he do it?\u201d The question was, \u201cWhich side are you on? Are you on Bill Clinton\u2019s side, or are you on Ken Starr\u2019s side?\u201d\nThe question was not \u201cDid he do it?\u201d The question was, \u201cWhich side are you on? Are you on Bill Clinton\u2019s side, or are you on Ken Starr\u2019s side?\u201d\nIsikoff: Clinton benefitted from two things. One is, first of all, in addition to lying, he had a very aggressive set of media-savvy defenders who knew how to shape his story to go after his political enemies and frame it that way. And then he had the excesses of his political enemies, who clearly went too far.\nAt the end of the day, impeachment is a political question. If the country is not with you, it doesn\u2019t make sense to move forward. It was clear, once the results of the 1998 elections came in and Republicans lost seats during a midterm [in which] they should have picked up big gains, that the public wasn\u2019t there. But Clinton\u2019s political foes were so determined to get him that they took it to a step where they turned the country against him.\nHarris: Michael, I want to challenge you, though\u2014\nIsikoff: Please do. Let\u2019s not all agree with each other.\nHarris: \u2014from what I think would be a\u2014would be a Clinton perspective. You spent a significant portion of the \u201990s exploring what was, I think, obvious at the time: Clinton\u2019s personal frailty, his vulnerability to weaknesses of the flesh, his sex life. And Donald Trump is exposed as writing a check to a pornographic star, and that is, \u201cWell, we need 24 or 48 hours to chew that over,\u201d and on we go. That does not seem to jibe.\nIsikoff: First of all, let me stop you. I reject the idea that my reporting was about his \u201csex life\u201d any more than the brilliant reporting that The New York Times and The New Yorker and others have done about the abuses of powerful men towards subordinate women\u2014nobody says that was about their \u201csex lives.\u201d\nGlasser: Yeah, I agree with Michael on that. I think that\u2019s important.\nIsikoff: That\u2019s the way the Clinton people wanted to craft it: I was the guy on the \u201cbimbo beat.\u201d That was the way they could dismiss the legitimate questions about their boss\u2019s abusive conduct towards multiple women and his lying about it. So I think that\u2019s a very important point. Should Trump\u2019s more-than-indiscretions get more attention? Yes, of course. But, as I said before, there\u2019s just so much with Trump that where does this rank? Does it trump the questions about whether he is mentally fit to be in office, whether he has the temperament to be president, whether he was in league with a foreign power in some way that got him elected in the first place? Those are all huge questions that need to be sorted out.\nI reject the idea that my reporting was about his \u2018sex life\u2019 any more than the brilliant reporting \u2026 others have done about the abuses of powerful men towards subordinate women. \u2026That\u2019s the way the Clinton people wanted to craft it: I was the guy on the \u2018bimbo beat.\u2019\nGlasser: I\u2019ve always believed that Bill Clinton\u2019s denial and how he handled the revelations of January 1998 were both the key to his political survival of the impeachment and trial and also the template for future presidents who would face enormous scandal. I believe that Donald Trump has learned from\u2014and will take to heart\u2014the lessons of how Clinton survived, politically, the year 1998, and not only weathered the scandal but did so for a long period of time with his reputation intact and even burnished. It was political genius how he handled it by lying. Lying was proven to work in some way that has enabled further the cynical and divisive political culture of Washington.\nOn Trump, what I would say is that we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to face in terms of the Mueller investigation, in terms of how these various strands\u2014the Russia investigation, Trump\u2019s business dealings\u2014how they play out, whether they come to a head in some sort of a political process on Capitol Hill or not. If they do, it may well be that they somehow merge with the questions about Donald Trump\u2019s character and comportment and behavior toward women. We haven\u2019t seen the end of the story yet. And it may well be because the politics are shifting that you could envision an article of impeachment that somehow makes reference to this conduct towards women.\nBaker: Most politicians end up being forced out because they feel ashamed or they don\u2019t want to live with the battering that comes with having their lives exposed, or they think it might be unfair coverage or what have you, right? Nobody forced Al Franken to resign except that Al Franken decided to resign. There was no process that required him to leave office; he decided to leave office. Bill Clinton refused. Democrats would have preferred in some way that he leave office because Al Gore would have been perfectly fine as a president; he would have been fine running in the 2000 elections as an incumbent. Bill Clinton said no.\n\n                            President Clinton sits in the Map Room of the White House on August 17, 1998, before making a public address admitting to his relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky. | AP Photo\nNow, his supporters say that was a heroic act on his part to resist the mob, but it also meant that Bill Clinton proved a point: They can\u2019t make you leave, so don\u2019t. And I think Donald Trump is the same way: He\u2019s willing to live with all kinds of things being said about him in a way that most politicians would have either shame or say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to live with this crap,\u201d or whatever. And it doesn\u2019t seem to bother him.\nIsikoff: We should probably talk a little bit about the dramatic changes in the news media, and how that affects coverage of these scandals and how they play out.\nHarris: Back then, we believed\u2014and I think it was true\u2014powerful platforms like Newsweek, like the Washington Post, like the New York Times could set the agenda of what the consequences and relevance of the story would be. I\u2019ve long since surrendered that belief that any institution sets the agenda; the mob of a million arguing voices does their thing\u2014nobody sets the agenda. What would have happened if we were in the current media climate in 1998?\nIsikoff: When Newsweek held the story, they were holding the story for a full week. There was no Twitter. Although Newsweek had a dedicated AOL website, I had never even seen it. Nobody read it. It was there for the sole purpose of posting the magazine when it came out. We had never put a story up\u2014\nBaker: But then you did, right? And that was a revolutionary moment.\nThe decision is made: We\u2019re going to post the story on our website. And it was like, \u2018Huh? How does that work?\u2019\u201d\nIsikoff: Right. So we have to give the devil his due. Matt Drudge posts this little item on a Saturday night [on] big screaming arguments at Newsweek about holding a story about the president\u2019s relationship with a former intern. Then everybody is like, \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Everybody is scrambling. By Tuesday, you guys [at the Post] break the story, so it\u2019s out there. But we knew we had more than anybody else. We had the tape; we had\u2014I had been talking to Tripp for months. The decision is made: We\u2019re going to post the story on our website. And it was like, \u201cHuh? How does that work? What do you do?\u201d We wrote a 10,000-word story or whatever it was. But since we didn\u2019t think anybody would even know how to find our website, we faxed the story around to news organizations all over town.\nGlasser: Yeah, and the fax was the key instrument, the revolutionary technology at the time. At the Washington Post, I had started work the week before as the deputy national editor for investigations. And the internet was considered a perk at the time at the Washington Post. And I did not actually even have access on my computer to the internet, and I was going to end up overseeing this coverage. I said, \u201cHow do you get information? How do you access the internet?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, you go to the library.\u201d It took three weeks of lobbying the top editors of the Washington Post to get me access to the internet. In the meantime, the president of the United States has almost been forced to resign from office because of the internet.\nBaker: This whole story as it played out over the year was a whole revolution in the media. You had the advent of Drudge, at least in a powerful public way; you had Michael\u2019s story first going up on the web; I wrote the first story that ever appeared on the Washington Post website about the step toward impeachment; we had Fox News, which really came into its own as a powerful force in politics in that year. All of these forces beginning to show how the media was going to transform ultimately into what it is today, without social media, which has then taken that three or four or five extra steps.\n\n                            A selection of New York newspapers on Aug. 18, 1998, after President Clinton revealed he'd had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. | AP Photo\nHarris: Do you think [having social media at the time] would have just accelerated the process and we all would have been in different camps, so Clinton would survive in this environment? Or would it have meant the whole project would have erupted in flames within the first week?\nIsikoff: I don\u2019t know. You had Fox News. That was around. You had MSNBC\u2014but it was not what it is today\u2014to defend Clinton. So, you know, it may have been worse for him if the technology was there, because would he have had the same access to defenders?\nGlasser: The flipside is Starr\u2019s investigation would have been completely different. I was struck rereading Michael\u2019s excellent account of all the wiring that Linda Tripp did and the taping [of Monica Lewinsky]. She did that because she was concerned of being called in as a witness; she was concerned about her own account of her relationship with Monica Lewinsky being called into question. Well, of course, in the era of email and texting and Facebook, there would have been so much evidence that a prosecutor would have been able to gather very quickly. The entrapment aspect of this would actually have gone away, because they would have just had all the evidence.\nIsikoff: That\u2019s a great point. There would have been text messages.\nGlasser: Yeah, of course there would have been. And Monica definitely would have saved them. If she\u2019s saving the dress, she definitely would have saved\u2014\nIsikoff: She would have been texting Linda after every one of her visits with Clinton.\nGlasser: Yeah, she would have been like, \u201cOh, my God. We did this. We did\u2014\u201d\nIsikoff: And it would have been right there.\nIn the era of email and texting and Facebook, there would have been so much evidence that a prosecutor would have been able to gather very quickly.\u201d\nBaker: One of the things that Clinton did that helped ensure his survival is, A, he made it partisan, and, B, he took advantage of the partisanship of his opponents. By making it a partisan thing, he forced Democrats who didn\u2019t approve of his behavior [and] who might have abandoned him under other circumstances to stand by him because they didn\u2019t want to stand with the other guys. That has only gotten more so in 20 years by virtue of the media and social media and the increasingly balkanized, polarized environment in which we live in. Everything is seen through the partisan lens, and it\u2019s so hard to get to that Nixonian era where basically Republicans were able to say, \u201cEnough. We don\u2019t believe that this president belongs here even though he\u2019s from our own party.\u201d\nIsikoff: You had a little moment of that when Clinton finally came clean and admitted it, and I think Joe Lieberman made that speech on the Senate which indicated he was about\u2014did he call for Clinton\u2019s resignation or he just\u2014\nBaker: Clinton was in Moscow, and I was with him at the time. It was an incredibly dramatic moment because Russia\u2019s economy was collapsing and the president of the United States was being called out by his own party on the floor of the Senate. And this is where the Republicans lost an opportunity: They preferred to go for an all-or-nothing, impeachment-or-nothing kind of attack rather than sitting together with the Joe Liebermans and the other disaffected Democrats\u2014of whom there were plenty\u2014and saying, \u201cLet\u2019s do a bipartisan censure,\u201d or whatever it is that will have an end result in which both parties spoke out and said, \u201cThis is unacceptable. We may not be pushing you out of office, but we don\u2019t think this is [appropriate] behavior by a president.\u201d\nHarris: Peter, one part I don\u2019t agree with you about Bill Clinton is [the idea] that he was kind of indifferent to the opinions or judgments of others, that he just compartmentalized and was sort of at peace with the false story he had to project. I think it pained him greatly. And this is the difference with Trump. I honestly think Trump is contemptuous of establishment institutions, establishment voices, establishment precedents. Bill Clinton \u2026 the presidency that he wanted would have been to have the acclaim of those establishment voices. Bill Clinton cared what the New York Times editorial page said about him. And he cared about whether he was a president being subpoenaed, whereas I honestly don\u2019t think Trump gives a damn.\nIsikoff: Yes, but go back to what I always thought was one of the telling moments after the scandal breaks and it\u2019s the darkest days. Who does Clinton talk to? Dick Morris. \u201cWhat are the numbers? Do a poll for me.\u201d And Morris is giving him the numbers \u2026 and Clinton is, like, writing them down. It was a cold, political calculation: \u201cWhat can I get away with? What can\u2019t I get away with?\u201d\nGlasser: He had to make a choice, and it\u2019s not that he was indifferent. He is a creature of the establishment; he flourished in it. He rose from obscurity to succeed in the institutions of American power\u2014Yale University and Oxford\u2014and American politics. He wasn\u2019t indifferent to it, but faced with a choice between that and his political survival, he chose his political survival. And in the end, we remember Bill Clinton as a gifted politician in part because he showed that he could overcome even a scandal such as this. He was gifted at politics, whether you think he was a good person or not. He was willing to do the thing that was immoral but successful when it came to staying in office and surviving a scandal. This was unprecedented. It wasn\u2019t merely chapter 87 in the crazy political scandals of the Trump era. We might receive it very differently today because we\u2019ve been living in a circus-like environment. This kind of circus in January 1998 was not the world that we\u2019re used to living in, and it was seen as something that, even for Bill Clinton, was a level of circus and spectacle that defied our ability to categorize it.\nIsikoff: You made the point before, Susan, that we don\u2019t know what Mueller\u2019s got or how he\u2019s going to present it. If he writes a report, one difference is Starr, being the independent counsel, had the mandate to prepare a report on his investigation. Mueller does not; he\u2019s a Justice Department employee. Under the Justice Department [regulations], he writes a report for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will have complete discretion as to whether to forward that to the Congress or not.\nGlasser: That\u2019s right. There is no mechanism set up by which one would officially transmit the findings of the Mueller investigation.\nIsikoff: There are so many different ways this could play out, but let\u2019s say that he prepares a report and it\u2019s not public. If the Democrats get back control of the House, they will demand to see the report.\nBaker: Yes.\nIsikoff: And they will demand Mueller\u2019s testimony. And that will be a moment of high drama, if Mueller testifies before the House Judiciary Committee in a prospective impeachment hearing.\nHarris: At the table we\u2019re sitting at, there is an empty chair. And I\u2019m just imagining that Bill Clinton is sitting at this chair. And we\u2019ve all spent a lot of time listening to him and speculating among ourselves about him. What do you think he would say about this conversation?\nBaker: What\u2019s the phrase that Steve Bannon likes? \u2018You\u2019re the one who lives rent-free in Bill Clinton\u2019s head.\u2019 What do you think?\nHarris: I think he would agree with the part of the conversation that says there is a kind of a linear link between the politics of that year of scandal, 1998, and politics as it exists today. And I think he would feel deeply aggrieved that rules and standards and media assumptions that got imposed upon him are seemingly imposed with no consequence\u2014either not imposed or posed with no real consequences\u2014on politicians that followed, including Trump.\nIsikoff: Here\u2019s a question for you: Have we seen or heard much from Bill Clinton ever since the Harvey Weinstein scandal erupted? \u2026 He has not been in public, which is extraordinary when you think about it.\nBaker: But on television we\u2019ve seen Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones. All these people are coming out and saying, \u201cMe too. Hey, we were the original #MeToo.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a question for you: have we seen or hear much from Bill Clinton ever since the Harvey Weinstein scandal erupted?\u201d\nIsikoff: Clinton\u2014I mean, it must be killing him, because he\u2019s such a public figure, how does he contain himself? But the fact that he is not out there saying anything, I think, says a lot about how views have changed.\nHarris: I feel that the original behavior that led to this is still deeply unsettled in Bill Clinton\u2019s mind. And the evidence I have for that is his own memoir \u2026 it\u2019s almost an hour-by-hour account of his presidency. \u2018And then I called Tony Blair, and then I stopped to grab a Diet Coke.\u2019 And in that tick-tock of his presidency, Monica Lewinsky enters the story not when they had their relationship starting in November 1995. She doesn\u2019t ever get a reference until this week in January 1998. And that, to me, said something telling and also kind of sad. We have to remember that there are human beings at the heart of this, and Monica Lewinsky is probably the biggest victim. She mattered not all except to the extent that she was thrown into this firestorm.\nIsikoff: That does remind me of another telling point from that episode: I believe Monica testified that she was not sure\u2014even after the first four or five times she had sexually serviced the president\u2014whether he knew her name. That is not your normal sexual straying infidelity. It gets into the power question that I think was so troubling.\n\n                            On August 18, 1998, President Clinton, daughter Chelsea and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton walk across the south lawn of the White House to board Marine One en route to Martha's Vineyard for a two week vacation. The previous night, the president confessed to a relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. | AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\nGlasser: Another name we haven\u2019t mentioned is that of Hillary Clinton, and we haven\u2019t talked about Chelsea Clinton, also victims in this scenario. It\u2019s fascinating, the extent to which over the last year and a half, Donald Trump was able to rewrite the narrative of Bill Clinton\u2019s scandal and his aggressive behavior toward women and pattern of lies and deception and rewrite that as a story about Hillary Clinton as his enabler. It\u2019s also an interesting and important footnote that arguably it was the Clinton impeachment scandal which gave rise to Hillary Clinton\u2019s independent political career.\nBaker: It\u2019s literally the day that he is being acquitted on the floor of the Senate after the trial that she is in the White House meeting with Harold Ickes, talking about this potential Senate race in New York and which counties she might do well in and so forth. It was really like the prequel to the next story.\nHarris: I recall Jay Leno, two weeks into it, he said, \u201cBill Clinton is doing so well in the polls that he\u2019s already planning his next sex scandal.\u201d But beneath the jokes, it is a reality that this moment deeply compromised a very promising presidency, and in my judgment, it compromised a brand of Clinton politics for which there were big prices to pay. One of those prices was paid by Al Gore. I think Hillary Clinton\u2019s aura and her brand of politics has been compromised with enormous consequences\u2014if you imagine a world in which Al Gore wins and George W. Bush doesn\u2019t, or you imagine a world where Hillary Clinton is now president and Donald Trump isn\u2019t. This moment 20 years ago, January 1998, had big consequences, maybe more than that are obvious, which continue to echo to this day.\nIsikoff: If Hillary Clinton had won the election, what would this conversation be like with Bill Clinton back in the White House? And would the Harvey Weinstein scandal have broken if Hillary Clinton had won the election? There are so many different ways you can think about this. But bottom line, we deal with the history that played out. We do look at this differently now than many of us did at the time. There was always the question about where Monica Lewinsky would rank when they write the obituary of Bill Clinton. Would it be in the first paragraph, the second paragraph, the third paragraph? I think there was a point at which it had probably dropped to three or four. I think it\u2019s now up there to two or possibly in the first one. And that\u2019s no small thing if you are Bill Clinton.\nThe story of Bill Clinton is now intertwined with that of Donald Trump, just as the legacy of Barack Obama is now intertwined in our minds with that of Donald Trump.\u201d\nBaker: He had successfully\u2014for a while\u2014rewritten history so that his was a presidency of peace and prosperity compared to what followed, so by the time 2008 comes around and his wife is running for the first time, people look back quite fondly on the Clinton presidency. And they said, \u201cWell, gosh, that was a time when we had 22 million more jobs and we were booming and we had relative peace around the world, and now here we are with this quagmire and a financial crisis and all.\u201d And now we\u2019re back talking about this again, and it\u2019s a complicated thing. That\u2019s what makes Clinton such a fascinating figure. There is this combination of promise and peril; his greatest strengths are also his greatest weaknesses. It\u2019s such a Shakespearian story for him to bring all this upon himself, and then defying his enemies\u2014both his tormentors and, in some ways, his saviors. He\u2019s a story we\u2019re going to be writing about and changing for many decades to come.\nGlasser: I think one of the reasons we\u2019re going to be changing the story is that Donald Trump has caused us to reexamine the legacy of most of our recent presidents. And it\u2019s going to look very different if you have someone like Trump who remains in office and is seen to have gotten away with accusations of a similar or even more serious gravity when it comes to attitudes and relations toward women. The story of Bill Clinton is now intertwined with that of Donald Trump, just as the legacy of Barack Obama is now intertwined in our minds with that of Donald Trump. So until we know the ending of the Trump story, we\u2019re not going to know how to look at this chapter in Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.\nHarris: Michael, I\u2019m going to give you the last word. Do you feel now that your reporting, intensely criticized at the time, has been vindicated? Do you have any regrets about the whole episode?\nAt his moment of greatest triumph, he sows the seeds for the greatest debacle of his political life.\u201d\nIsikoff: Yes and no. Yes, vindicated. Although the criticism was unpleasant, I never had any doubts, nor did my editors, that we handled it in the right way. I think we got it entirely right. What we published, it holds up, so, no; no regrets on that score.\nI would like to end on one point about just how complicated Bill Clinton is and his greatest strengths are his greatest weaknesses. I want to take you back to the Paula Jones episode for one moment. When I first started looking into that, the White House communications person at the time was George Stephanopoulos. And Stephanopoulos made the point to me: Do you realize when this event with Paula Jones was supposed to have happened? It was the day after Bill Clinton flies back from Cleveland at the Democratic Leadership Conference, where he gave this rousing speech that essentially put him on the map as the probable front-runner for the Democratic nomination. It was his highest moment in national politics. He was pumped. He could taste it: He was going to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. And what does he do the very next day? Stephanopoulos made the point that it proves it couldn\u2019t have happened: \u2018Do you think he\u2019s that crazy?\u2019 In fact, it\u2019s all there. At his moment of greatest triumph, he sows the seeds for the greatest debacle of his political life. And I think there is something very large\u2014when you talk about \u201cShakespearean\u201d\u2014to say about all that.\n***\nPeter Baker is chief White House correspondent for the New York Times.\nSusan B.

BAML calculates that traders poured a \"massive\" $58 billion into stocks over the past four weeks, the most ever for a period of that length.\n\nStill, BAML is constructive on stocks in the immediate term due to a combination of continued global central bank accommodation and strong corporate earnings growth.

It is a loss for the parliament,\" Minister of State for Women's Affairs Jean Oghassabian told The Associated Press. \"The main obstacles are mentality, a philosophy of life, and this needs time,\" he said.\n\nIn 2009, only four women managed to be elected in the outgoing parliament, which make up three percent of its 128 legislators. It was a drop from 2005, when six women were elected. Since 2004, one or at most two women have been in high government posts.\n\nCompared with other countries in the region, Lebanon ranks as one of the lowest in terms of female representation in parliament, with only Oman, Kuwait and Yemen having fewer. Oman and Kuwait have one and two women representatives respectively. War-torn Yemen has none and is currently without a functioning parliament.\n\n\"In politics, there seems to be some kind of invisible barrier for women to really break through,\" Christina Lassen, European Union Ambassador to Lebanon, told The Associated Press at a conference held last week to promote women's representation in Lebanon.\n\nThree months before the vote, the Women's Affairs Ministry in collaboration with the United Nations and the EU launched a campaign to boost women's numbers in the elections, with the slogan: \"Half the society, half the parliament.\"\n\nBillboards went up in several Beirut districts. Programs on local TV stations about women in politics are airing weekly and local groups say they are training women candidates on public speaking.\n\nOghassabian said last year's decision to appoint a man to the newly created portfolio was meant to send a message that it is also \"a man's duty\" to fight for women's rights.\n\nHolding parliamentary elections in Lebanon is a feat in itself. Scheduled for May, these are the first elections in the country since 2009. Previous votes were delayed amid instability and haggling over a new election law.\n\nSeats in the Lebanese parliament are allotted according to sects, with each community distributing them according to region and strongholds. In this complex confessional-based political system, adding a women's quota was too complicated for some to contemplate, said Nora Mourad, a gender researcher with the United Nations Development Program.\n\nLast year, the politicians refused to even discuss a female quota in the new law. Members of the powerful Shia group, Hezbollah, walked out of the room before the discussion began.\n\n\"We are against a quota. We are against imposing conditions from the outside on our policies and roles and work,\" said Rima Fakhry, a politician from the conservative Shia group. \"The women movement considers that women should reach decision-making positions. For them, it is in parliament. We differ with those movements.\"\n\nAlthough Fakhry herself is a senior member of the political bureau of Hezbollah, she told the audience at the conference that her group doesn't see the role of a legislator as befitting for a woman in Lebanon. Her group will not nominate women to run for office.\n\n\"For us, the woman is a woman. She must work to realize the main goals she exists for. These are not different from those of men. But the difference is in the details,\" she said. \"She has a home. She is a mother and must bring up generations. This takes a lot of the woman's time.\"\n\nEven though the country's civil war ended 28 years ago, its politics are still dominated by former family dynasties, and elections are often settled behind closed doors.\n\nMost women in politics have their posts because they are related to influential male politicians. Of the four women currently in parliament, one is the aunt of the current prime minister, another is the wife of a party leader, and the other two are the daughters of an assassinated media figure and a former minister.\n\nStill, Oghassabian said he expects at least 20 women to make it into parliament, and dozens more to run.\n\nThe new law introduced a complicated proportional representation system that would preserve the sectarian nature of the parliament. But some argue it will offer women and independents a better chance.\n\nLocal groups, along with the UN and EU, are encouraging political parties to have a voluntary quota for women on their lists. Women's groups are contemplating all-women lists as well as a campaign of \"no-woman, no-vote\" to pressure political parties to include women on their lists.\n\nIn Wednesday's conference, representatives from the political parties said internal deliberations are ongoing. One senior member of the Future party said he will recommend 20 percent women's representation. Another, from the Progressive Socialist Party, said it has commissioned a review of internal literature to ensure women's issues and requests are reflected.\n\nVictoria El-Khoury Zwein, a potential candidate with a new party called Seven, said she's sceptical that veteran parties would give women a winning chance. But she said with proportional representation, she's optimistic she needs fewer votes to make it.\n\n\"There must be 15 percent of the population who want a new political class,\" she said. \"It is not an easy battle.

He also has a staff embroiled in legal difficulties and facing a second year of likely continued investigation. For a candidate who said he hires only the \u201cbest people,\u201d President Trump has set new records in human relations problems internally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegislative accomplishments: President Trump was able to pass his signature tax bill which was a big legislative victory (though not a political victory since this bill is widely unpopular and has not helped his approval numbers). Outside of this legislative win, other victories have been few and far between. In fact, he had fewer legislative victories than any president in the last fifty years. The \u201cdeal maker\u201d still has to show he can make deals, and that will only get more difficult in a mid-term election year and its aftermath.\n\n\n\n\nWhen President Trump was elected, and as he began his presidency, there were many questions concerning his temperament and his emotional ability to lead. In fact, nearly 25 percent of voters who supported him in November 2016 had questions about his temperament, and they hoped his time in office would reassure them.\n\n\nIt hasn\u2019t.\n\n\nAnd he ends his first year embroiled in more questions about his temperament and mental acuity, highlighted by senior staff wondering out loud about this in the New York Times bestseller \u201cFire and Fury.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt was hoped and suggested by some that Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner would be a moderating and anchoring influence on the Trump presidency. This has not happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany applauded President Trump bringing on former generals James Mattis as Defense secretary, H.R. McMaster as national security adviser, and John Kelly as White House chief of staff, arguing they would provide a stabilizing base and modulate a \u201cshoot from the hip,\u201d temperamental chief executive. While the back story of their influence isn\u2019t fully known at this point, from the president\u2019s communications and Twitter feed, and interaction with world leaders, the generals, like the family, have failed in their training mission.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump started his term with a solid base who helped bring him into office, and a rather large resistance group who opposed him at every turn. In the course of the year, his base, while solid has shrunk and today only 24 percent of Americans strongly approve of his job performance. The resistance to him has grown bigger and more vehement in opposition \u2014 today 49 percent of Americans strongly disapprove of his job performance, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll.\n\n\nThis is going to create many problems in the rest of his term - legislatively and politically.\n\n\nSo we end year one with some answers on what a Trump presidency would look and act like, but we have many more questions about what is ahead for this administration, which seems to wear disruption and divisiveness as a badge of honor.\n\n\nI remain hopeful that at some point President Trump will adjust his presidency and represent all Americans, but my doubts of that happening have increased dramatically through year one.\n\n\nThis story is the final part of a weeklong series examining the first year of the Trump administration.", "title": "Analysis: A year in, Trump's presidency has been disruptive and unique", "sourceId": "abc-news", "sourceName": "ABC News", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-year-trumps-presidency-disruptive-unique/story?id=52477741", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T11:00:29Z"}, {"textData": "Inflation is what could jolt the markets this year.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what the tactical asset allocation team at DNB Asset Management is preparing for.\n\n\u201cInflation surprising on the upside is the biggest risk,\u201d Torje Gundersen, portfolio manager, said in an interview in Oslo on Thursday. \u201c2018 can be the year when stronger inflation surprises a lot of investors.\u201d\n\nGlobal economic growth spurred the stock rally in 2017. But inflation expectations are likely to rise as the prolonged expansion eats into spare capacity and the U.S. cuts taxes. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note climbed in the past week to the highest levels since 2014.\n\n\u201cThe timing of the tax cuts are therefore wrong in our view,\u201d said Gundersen, whose team manages about 33 billion kroner ($4 billion). \u201cThe effect is comparable to pouring gas onto a campfire. The economy will overheat and financial conditions will tighten more than the markets expect.\u201d\n\nGundersen sees the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rising toward 3 percent. DNB\u2019s asset allocation team is neutral equities and bonds, but has sold out of its holdings in U.S. and European investment grade bonds.\n\n\u201cThey have a low yield and long duration,\u201d he said. \u201cIf interest rates rise there\u2019s a risk of negative return.\u201d\n\nInstead, Gundersen holds Nordic high-yield bonds with shorter duration. He also takes region and sector bets to seek excess return in the stock market. His portfolios are overweight energy, materials and industrials, which are likely to get some support from accelerating inflation.\n\nNo Catastrophe\n\nHe also prefers an overweight in technology companies. \u201cThey have a very strong underlying growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t cheap but they aren\u2019t more expensive compared with the rest of the market.\u201d\n\nThe DNB Aktiv 80 fund had an average annual return of 14 percent in the past five years. But investors should expect lower returns in the coming years, according to Gundersen.\n\n\u201cSo this year it will be a struggle between earnings growth and rising interest rates. And what should the pricing of stocks be then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a catastrophe scenario for the stock market but lower return expectations than last year.\u201d", "title": "This $4 Billion Manager Is Preparing for an Inflation Surprise", "sourceId": "bloomberg", "sourceName": "Bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-21/this-4-billion-manager-is-preparing-for-an-inflation-surprise", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T11:00:00Z"}, {"textData": "DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Davos is the conference everyone loves to hate.\n\nNot me.\n\nAs a financial columnist with an unabashedly globalist remit (sorry Steve Bannon) the annual World Economic Forum in Switzerland is the most efficient few days of my entire year.\n\nStarting in December, I line up meetings with sources, some of whom I have known for years and others that are totally new to me, from all parts of the world.\n\nWithout exaggeration, a typical three hours in Davos for me will include off-the-record chats with the head of a large Spanish bank, a senior official from Saudi Arabia\u2019s government, a cosmetics entrepreneur from Mexico, the CEO of a Japanese food company and the founder of yet-another fintech startup from Finland.\n\nSince I am based in New York, I tend to concentrate on international contacts and people from places that are a bit more difficult to get to like Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThis is no substitute for getting on a plane, visiting these countries regularly and meeting folks on the ground.

I certainly go into the meetings with an agenda, but invariably some topic curated by the forum\u2019s organizers finds its way into the discussion.\n\nLooking at this year\u2019s schedule, for example, I have no doubt that many people will want to discuss the extraordinary reforms taking place in India, where I was fortunate to spend two weeks in December.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s keynote address will be must-see Davos programming for every CEO, banker or policymaker on the ground. Similarly, the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump will be on everyone\u2019s minds, no matter how polarizing a figure he has been on the world stage.\n\nOf course, it would be disingenuous of me to omit the softer side of Davos. The parties in the evenings are a fantastic way to catch up less formally with existing contacts and make new ones.

The blizzard warnings now stretch from eastern Colorado to southern Minnesota, including a large portion of Nebraska.\n\n\nThis storm will track towards the upper Midwest over the next 48 hours, bringing a significant snowfall from eastern Colorado to Northern Wisconsin. This storm has already brought heavy snow to parts of the Rocky Mountains. Salt Lake City, for example, picked up over 8 inches of snow on Saturday causing treacherous travel on I-80 and I-15. Treacherous travel due to heavy blowing snow was also reported on I-80 in Wyoming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning the snow is falling in the Colorado Rockies and will be expanding into the metropolitan Denver area shortly. Conditions in Denver will deteriorate Sunday morning and further into the day. Locally 4 to 8 inches of snow is likely for the Denver area, with nearly a foot possible in the mountains and foothills. Flight delays and cancellations will be likely Sunday at Denver International Airport. Snow has also already expanded northward towards Cheyenne and the South Dakota-Nebraska border.\n\n\nConditions will deteriorate in Nebraska and Southern South Dakota Sunday, followed by southern Minnesota by Sunday evening. In addition to the snowfall, winds will be gusting locally over 30 mph as the storm intensifies Sunday night into Monday. Near blizzard conditions will be likely in this region during this time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday morning, heavy snow will be falling from Nebraska to Western Wisconsin. School cancellations, flight delays, and road closures will be likely in Sioux Falls, Sioux City, and Minneapolis.\n\n\nBy Tuesday morning, the storm will move into the Great Lakes region and bring a heavy rain threat for the Northeast. The combination of heavy rain, mild temperatures, and existing ice jams could cause localized flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere remains some degree of uncertainty where the gradient of heaviest snow totals will be in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. The current forecast includes a narrow axis of locally over 12 inches of snow from near Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to the Southern suburbs of Minneapolis. There is a potential for this axis to expand eastward. Important to note that there will be a fairly sharp gradient from notable nuisance snowfall. The heaviest snow likely misses Rapid City just to the south as well as misses Des Moines just to the north.\n\n\nIn addition to the heavy snow, many locations will also see a little bit of freezing rain and drizzle ahead of the heavier snow.\n\n\nIn addition the snowfall, a cold front swinging across the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley will bring the chance for severe weather. A slight risk for severe storms for parts of northeast Texas, southeast Oklahoma, southwest Arkansas and northwest Louisiana. This threat region includes Dallas and Little Rock. The main threat will be damaging winds, however brief tornadoes will be possible. The thunderstorms are expected to develop later Sunday evening near Waco to Dallas, and then move north and east during the overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday will be another day with above average temperatures for much of the eastern U.S. Temperatures in much of this region are forecast to be 10 to 20 degrees above average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York City, Boston and Washington, D.C. will all be 5 to 10 degrees above their average for the date. Across parts of the South, temperatures are 10 to 15 degrees above average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike last weekend, with the milder temperatures, the threat for localized ice jams, and thin ice remain a concern across parts of the Northeast. As a storm approaches from the west, heavy rain will arrive in the Northeast on Tuesday, which could enhance the threat for localized flooding near area waterways affected by ice jams.\n\n\nAfter the rain passes, it will turn more seasonable.

Amir Hatami appear to be a trial balloon to test the reaction of the idea, long pushed by Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate. Protests over the country's poor economy last month escalated into demonstrations directly challenging the government.\n\nBut whether the Guard would agree remains unclear, as the organization is estimated to hold around a third of the country's entire economy.\n\nHatami, the first non-Guard-affiliated military officer to be made defense minister in nearly 25 years, made the comments in an interview published Saturday by the state-run IRAN newspaper. He said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered both the country's regular military and the Guard to get out of businesses not directly affiliated to their work.\n\n\"Our success depends on market conditions,\" the newspaper quoted Hatami as saying.\n\nHe did not name the companies that would be privatized. The Guard did not immediately acknowledge the supreme leader's orders in their own publications, nor did Khamenei's office.\n\nThe Guard formed out of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution as a force meant to protect its political system, which is overseen by Shiite clerics. It operated parallel to the country's regular armed forces, growing in prominence and power during the country's long and ruinous war with Iraq in the 1980s. It runs Iran's ballistic missile program, as well its own intelligence operations and expeditionary force.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1980s war, authorities allowed the Guard to expand into private enterprise.\n\nToday, it runs a massive construction company called Khatam al-Anbia, with 135,000 employees handling civil development, the oil industry and defense issues. Guard firms build roads, man ports, run telecommunication networks and even conduct laser eye surgery.\n\nThe exact scope of all its business holdings remains unclear, though analysts say they are sizeable. The Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which long has been critical of Iran and the nuclear deal it struck with world powers, suggests the Guard controls \"between 20 and 40 percent of the economy\" of Iran through significant influence in at least 229 companies.\n\nIn his comments, Hatami specifically mentioned Khatam al-Anbia, but didn't say whether that too would be considered by the supreme leader as necessary to privatize. The Guard and its supporters have criticized other business deals attempting to cut into their piece of the economy since the nuclear deal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

Simply put, markets are pretty dull, with little to no major fluctuations going on. Stocks simply keep rising.\n\nThat, in turn, is leading investors to look for more and more risky ways of making money, which Deutsche Bank believes is part of the reason for the huge rise seen in the cryptocurrency markets in recent months.\n\n\"The current 'triple-low environment' of low interest rates, low spreads, and low volatility has given birth to new asset classes like implied volatility (ETFs selling volatility), and cryptocurrencies,\" the reports authors write.\n\nBut where does the correlation between volatility and bitcoin come in? Here's the explanation from Muraki, Torii, and Xu (emphasis ours):\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies are closely watched by retail investors, affecting their risk preferences for stocks and other risk assets. Although institutional investors recognize that stocks and other asset valuations may have entered bubble territory (US equities\u2019 average P/E is around 20x), they cannot help but continue their risk-taking. Now, a growing number of institutional investors are watching cryptocurrencies as the frontier of risk-taking to evaluate the sustainability of asset prices.\n\n\"The result is that institutional investors, who are supposed to value assets using their sophisticated financial literacy, analysis, and information-gathering strengths, are actually seeking feedback about the market from cryptocurrency prices (which are mainly formed by retail investors).\"\n\nBasically, Muraki argues, as volatility in traditional assets drops, the price of bitcoin and other reasonably mainstream cryptocurrencies rises, as investors look for a way to make money. Here's the chart from Deutsche Bank showing just that:\n\nWhile traditional market volatility remains close to rock bottom, the same is certainly not true of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Cryptocurrencies this week rode a rollercoaster, with bitcoin dropping as much as 25% in a single day early in the week, before rebounding aggressively.\n\nAt one point the market had lost $340 billion of value with the sell-off at its most severe on Tuesday and Wednesday.", "title": "DEUTSCHE BANK: Correlation between bitcoin and Wall Street's 'Fear Index' is increasing 'dramatically'", "sourceId": "business-insider", "sourceName": "Business Insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-wall-street-volatility-index-correlation-deutsche-bank-2018-1", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T09:44:00Z"}, {"textData": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to build nine desalination plants for more than 2 billion riyals ($530 million) on the Red Sea coast, its environment minister said on Sunday.\n\nThe plants will have capacity of 240,000 cubic meters of water per day and will be completed in less than 18 months, Abdulrahman al-Fadhli wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nThe project, which the minister said was ordered by King Salman in a royal decree, will help government-owned Saudi Saline Water Conversion Corp (SWCC) raise production efficiency and cut operating and capital costs, Fadhli added.\n\nHe gave no details on funding.\n\nSaudi Arabia said in 2016 it planned to use public-private partnerships (PPP) with local and foreign companies to fund infrastructure projects.\n\nIn August, it said it would develop resorts on about 50 Red Sea islands, completing the first phase of that project - which is backed by its Public Investment Fund (PIF) - in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n($1=3.75 Saudi riyals)", "title": "Saudi to build nine desalination plants on Red Sea", "sourceId": "reuters", "sourceName": "Reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-water/saudi-to-build-nine-desalination-plants-on-red-sea-idUSKBN1FA0BG", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T09:43:41Z"}, {"textData": "Figuring out just how we go from stressed to sick on the physiological level is the subject of a new study published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology. The key, according to this study, can be found in the way our immune systems interact with our nervous systems. While the immune system is great at defending against microscopic bugs, \u201cfight or flight is not going to help me sift through all of those emails and feel bad about returning them late,\u201d lead study author Adam Moeser told me.\n\nIn order to take a closer look at this link between stress and illness, Moeser\u2019s team studied an innate immune cell type called mast cells that live in abundance in your gut wall and your skin. Moeser, an associate professor and the Matilda Wilson Endowed Chair in the college of Veterinary Medicine at Michigan State University, describes these mast cells as \u201csurveillance cells that help the body defend against any type of challenge or stress.\u201d\n\nThese cells are among the first to be activated not only in the case of infection, but also to \u201cany perceived threat,\u201d even one psychological in nature. In other words, they act as \u201calarm cells\u201d in the body, responding within seconds to the onset or exposure to stress.\n\n\u201cThere was even a study that showed mast cells in our gut become activated when someone is nervous about public speaking,\u201d Moeser explained. \u201cSo it\u2019s really this mind-body signal connection.\u201d\n\nLike anything good, too much of an immune response can be a bad thing. Mast cells are important immune defense barrier on the one hand, but when the stress response becomes \u201ctoo overwhelming, where we can\u2019t cope or return to our homeostatic place,\" Moeser said. \"The mast cells switch from being protective to actually pathogenic.\"\n\nToo many overactive mast cells are indicated in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and asthma, but they are often just the tip of an immune cascade. What was once a helper becomes a hindrance, leading to increased inflammation. Mast cells trigger the release of histamines (causing itching and swelling), encourage mucus production and produce pain by acting on sensory nerves in the body that signal the brain to amp up your pain response.\n\nTo better understand this process, Moeser\u2019s team homed in on a specific type of stress receptor that lives on the mast cell, known as CRF1 (corticotropin-releasing factor receptor subtype 1). This receptor releases a substance when it perceives stress \u2014 which could be a sudden meeting with your boss or an actual pathogen.\n\nResearchers modified these receptors in mice and in human mast cells (grown in petri dishes) in order to measure their response to different types of stressors, including psychological and immunological stress. When the receptor numbers were reduced, the mast cells\u2019 activity during stress was also reduced, leading to \u201cless disease outcomes in the physiology,\u201d Moeser said.", "title": "I've always lived with stress.

SUBSCRIBE\n\nIn decades past, there was bipartisan support for policies that laid the basis for a long period of broadly shared prosperity. Unfortunately, this consensus seems to have been replaced by the narrow-minded greed of the very rich and, insofar as they can continue to get their way, the story is not likely to end well.\n\nTake, for instance, the Republican tax plan, which passed in December and contained a potpourri of tax breaks for special interest groups and high-income households. Its centerpiece was a large cut in the corporate income tax; the plan lowered the rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.\n\nThe Trump administration claimed that this cut, coupled with various sweeteners like full expensing of new investments, would set off an investment boom. According to the administration, U.S. companies would bring back factories from overseas and foreign companies would rush to take advantage of low U.S. taxes, and this surge in investment would lead to more jobs and higher productivity growth, eventually translating into higher wages for workers.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice story, but there is little reason to believe that things will pan out as advertised.\n\nThe 1986 tax cut did not lead to an investment boom. In fact, investment actually fell relative to the size of the economy in the next two years.\n\nFirst, we tried cutting corporate taxes to stimulate the economy before: Although it received little attention during this most recent debate, the corporate rate was lowered from 46 percent to 35 percent in 1986, roughly comparable to the current cut. If we consider the share of profits that firms get to keep, the 1986 cut meant that the share kept increased from 54 percent to 65 percent, a 20 percent increase. The latest tax cut increased the share of profits that companies get to keep by 22 percent, going from 65 percent to 79 percent.\n\nThe 1986 tax cut did not, however, lead to an investment boom. In fact, investment actually fell relative to the size of the economy in the next two years. So, it\u2019s hard to believe that the slightly larger tax cut in the new bill will have a more positive impact on investment.\n\nBesides which, as a practical matter, tax rates have been shown to be a relatively minor factor in determining where companies invest \u2013 but they do affect where companies have their profits appear. For example, Apple reports that a huge share of its profits were earned in Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is just 12.5 percent, and Google claims to earn billions in the Cayman Islands, where the tax rate is even lower.\n\nTax rates have been shown to be a relatively minor factor in determining where companies invest, but they do affect where companies have their profits appear.\n\nThese companies do not invest vast sums nor create enormous numbers of jobs in these tax havens; they are just playing accounting games to minimize their tax liability. That can earn those countries some additional tax revenue, but it does not create the sort of jobs and growth for which most policymakers are looking.\n\nIn any case, even the new U.S. corporate tax rate is too high to qualify us for tax haven status, so we are not going to see European and Japanese corporations setting up fake operations in the U.S. in order to claim this country provides the basis for all of their profits. At best, we will see some more repatriation of income from companies, like Apple, that have been using tax havens \u2013 which, based on past history, will end up in the pockets of shareholders.\n\nBut what is perhaps most disturbing about the Republican tax plan is that it seems to steer the United States in the opposite direction of proven paths to growth. Looking back in the past, whether across states or across countries, low tax rates have never been the spur to growth. The spur to growth has been a well-trained and well-educated workforce, coupled with the infrastructure needed to support growth.\n\nToday, the booming areas are not low-tax states like Arkansas and Mississippi, but relatively high-tax states like New York, Massachusetts and California.\n\nFor example, the long boom that followed World War II was associated with a huge increase in college enrollment and high school graduation rates, not tax cuts. We built the national highway system, which was the basis for the suburbanization of this period and was associated with the explosion of the automobile sector and a wide variety of related industries. In addition, publicly-funded research had massive spinoffs in everything from aerospace to the internet.\n\nIf we look across states today, the booming areas are not low-tax states like Arkansas and Mississippi. Rather, we see the greatest prosperity in relatively high-tax states like New York, Massachusetts and California. Businesses are attracted by the highly skilled workers in these states. And, while some of these workers are educated in these states, workers come from around the country and around the world because these are considered desirable places for highly educated people to both work and live.\n\nThe same is true comparing countries across the globe; in fact, the countries in which workers are most prosperous all have much larger government sectors than the United States. In Germany, whose workers enjoy high pay and long vacations, government spending accounts for 43.8 percent of GDP compared to just 37.6 percent in the United States, according to the OECD.\n\nInstead of focusing on tax cuts, it would be good if the Republicans can look to the economic success stories of the present and recent past.\n\nIn France, where workers have enjoyed substantial wage gains over the last four decades and rank near the top in productivity per hour, the government accounts for 56.6 percent of the economy. There is a similar story for the prosperous Scandinavian countries: In Norway, President Trump\u2019s apparent preferred country of origin for new immigrants, government spending accounts for 48.8 percent of the economy.\n\nInstead of focusing on tax cuts, it would be good if the Republicans can look to the economic success stories of the present and recent past. Spending more to promote clean technologies can help keep U.S. companies among the world leaders in the area. Additional support for installing solar or wind energy and buying electric cars would also help. And, new funding to make college tuition free and reduce the student loan debt of recent grads would also help to expand the supply of skilled labor, as would more support for community colleges and other forms of training.\n\nThis route might not be the current orthodoxy among Republicans, but, unlike tax cuts, it is a proven path to broadly shared prosperity, and not just short-term profits.\n\nDean Baker is a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Studies have shown that people with Dark Tetrad personality traits \u2014 narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism \u2014 are more likely to say trolling is their favourite internet activity.\n\nResearch has also shown that men are more likely than women to bully people online.\n\nThe amount of psychopaths in the global population is thought to be about 1%. That means for people with hundreds of friends on social media, you might be in with a good chance of at least one of them being a diagnosable psychopath.\n\nWith trolling, a psychopath can use anonymity as a mask to fulfil their psychopathic tendencies, while maintaining a normal persona in real life. But this is difficult to do with a personal Facebook profile. So how would you be able to tell?\n\nThere are some obvious signs of psychopathy, such as the person not seeming to care whether they are posting provocative or toxic content. Psychopaths have something called a \"resistance to chaos,\" which means they do not get wound up by drama. In fact, they sometimes thrive on the fact they are causing other people stress and discomfort.\n\nBut there are more subtle signs too. According to one study of 6,724 participants, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, people who score high in psychopathy personality tests often write posts relating to their own needs and satisfaction. They also tended to write more posts about authority-related issues and politics.\n\nThe authors of the study offered two explanations for the focus on politics.\n\n\"One interpretation is that psychopathic individuals are attracted to these topics because they revolve around issues of power, authority, and conflict that they might find particularly attractive,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"In addition, these topics on social media are often rife with conflict and may provide a venue for aggressive online behaviours that psychopathic individuals are prone to engage in.\"\n\nThe second explanation is that there has been high levels of exposure to inflammatory political material on social media, which could have \"unleashed psychopathic tendencies in some individuals.\"\n\nFor example, do you have a friend who is always posting provocative political articles, even though they always receive a backlash? They could be getting enjoyment out of antagonising people. They might not believe in whatever they are posting, but they are too satisfied by the chaos they create to stop.\n\nThe third sign of Dark Tetrad traits was that Machiavellianists wrote shorter posts with shorter sentences. One theory for this was they may share less because it allows them to have more control over how others see them.\n\nA different study, also published in Computers in Human Behavior, looked at Machiavellianism specifically \u2014 behaviours associated with cynicism, emotional detachment, and the willingness to manipulate people.\n\nResults showed that Machiavellian men and women engage in higher levels of self-monitoring, self-promotion, aggression, and dishonesty on Facebook. The women were found to be more aggressive to close friends, and the men boasted about themselves more.\n\nAn example of the relational aggression the researchers found would be when you see a friend jumping on someone else's status to criticise their opinion. Another example could be when an older relative comments on one of your posts in a patronising way, suggesting you are ignorant of the topic.\n\nNone of these are sure signs that someone is a psychopath or a narcissist.

That gives lawmakers one more deadline to act before the shutdown is in full force.\n\nPublicly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are dug in to their opposite positions.

The vote was 50-49, with 60 votes needed to advance the measure.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats dug in their heels publicly over who\u2019s to blame for the shutdown while behind the scenes lawmakers continued to discuss a short-term stopgap bill. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of mischaracterizing the senator\u2019s discussions with Trump.

But he said Friday that he\u2019s not talking about how much he practiced or how the injury happened.\n\nBrady was listed as questionable for Sunday's 3:05 p.m. EST game after limited participation in the Pats' Friday practice. He saw limited action Wednesday as well, and completly sat out Thursday's session.\n\nThe Boston Globe, however, citing a \"league source,\" reported that Brady would be ready to start Sunday, and that the Patriots weren't expecting \"any major problems\" from Brady's hand.\n\nOne thing the four-time Super Bowl MVP was clear about was the challenge he expects from a Jaguars team ranked second in the NFL in total and scoring defense.\n\n\"It's a very unique challenge,\" Brady said. \"I think their front three, their linebackers, are very instinctive and very fast. And great cover guys in the secondary. Ball-hawking defense. They strip it off you, they sack you. ... So they're a good defense.\"\n\nBrady appeared on the Patriots' weekly injury report several times during the latter half of this season with injuries to both his Achilles tendon and his left shoulder, but the all-star Patriot has never missed a playoff start during his 18-year career.\n\n\"Tom always tends to show up in big games. This is a big game,\" receiver Danny Amendola said. \"(He's) super tough. The toughest. He's a warrior, he's a competitor and there's really only one reason why he's here, and that's to play football. \"\n\nRegardless, the Jaguars are preparing for a game with Brady in the huddle. Defensive tackle Marcell Dareus, who spent more than six seasons with the Bills, might be more familiar with Brady than any other Jacksonville player. He said typical methods of rattling a quarterback don't apply when it comes to Brady.\n\n\"You can hit Brady, but hitting him isn't what's going to get to him. It's constantly being that gnat in his face,\u201d Dareus said.\n\nBrady's former teammate said he loves playing against him.\n\n\"He's phenomenal to watch,\" Dareus said. \"You sack him he's going to get up and just keep rolling. He's that competitive spirit, like, 'OK, you got me. Now I'm fixing to go throw this touchdown the next play. Forty yards. You happy about that sack? But there you go.' That's just his mentality. I like it.\"\n\nIf Brady can't play Sunday, the Patriots would look to backup Brian Hoyer.\n\n\"I'm always preparing to play because the truth of reality is you never know when your name's gonna be called,\" Hoyer said Thursday.\n\nHoyer, a former Patriot, was acquired in midseason when the Patriots traded Jimmy Garoppolo to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nNew England hasn't called any quaterterback's name in the postseason other than Brady's since the 1990s.\n\nThe Jaguars scored eight defensive touchdowns this season including the playoffs, three more than any other team. Cornerback Jalen Ramsey had four interceptions during the regular season and also had one in the wild-card win over Buffalo.\n\nRamsey said he \u201cfully expects\u201d to see Brady on the field Sunday. Fans will be hoping for the same thing.\n\nSunday's other championship game will feature the Minnesota Vikings against the Philadelphia Eagles, beginning at 6:40 p.m.\n\nThe winners of the two contests will meet Feb. 4 in Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "title": "Tom Brady's playing status unclear ahead of Sunday's AFC title game", "sourceId": "fox-news", "sourceName": "Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2018/01/21/tom-bradys-playing-status-unclear-ahead-sundays-afc-title-game.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T09:00:00Z"}, {"textData": "Visitors walk in front of the U.S. Capitol and Washington Monument near the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in Washington on Jan. 20.\n\nEverybody said they didn\u2019t want a government shutdown.\n\nThere even seemed to be an easy way out: Democrats get a compromise to deal with hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children in exchange for President Donald Trump\u2019s demand for tighter border security with Mexico, including his oft-mentioned wall.\n\nThe compromise never materialized. The White House wouldn\u2019t cede on legal status and Democrats dug in on refusing to fund the government without it. And suddenly, the collapse of this potential solution -- a border barrier for a plan known by the acronym DACA -- drove the nation to its first shutdown since 2013.\n\nThat this issue could shutter the government speaks to the powerful hold the immigration issue has on both parties\u2019 most enthusiastic voters -- to Democrats\u2019 vision of themselves as an party of inclusion and to Republicans\u2019 vision of themselves as defending the very idea of what it means to be an American.\n\nFor Democrats, a restive voting base was exerting maximum election-year pressure on lawmakers to use the Jan. 19 shutdown deadline to fund the government as leverage to secure a long-sought policy victory: protecting some 690,000 young undocumented immigrants registered under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as \"dreamers.\"\n\nRepublicans have challenged the legality of DACA and Trump has directed an end to it in March.\n\n\u2018No Going Back\u2019\n\n\u201cIf Democrats don\u2019t force Republicans to come to the table and keep their promise to protect the dreamers, 800,000 people could be deported,\u201d said Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama who\u2019s been using his media company to fire up a hard core of activist Democratic voters. Once they\u2019re gone, \u201cThere\u2019s no going back.\u201d\n\nDemocratic elected officials are propelled by their growing reliance on Hispanic voters and their belief that they\u2019ll be rewarded by if they take a hard line in favor of dreamers, who are mostly of Latino origin. Hispanics make up about 18 percent of the U.S. population and one of the fastest growing demographic groups in the country.\n\n\u201cThe dreamers are members of our community who have been with for as long as they can remember and don\u2019t even know another country,\u201d said Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat. \u201cWe don\u2019t like people abusing our community members, which is exactly what the president has been doing.\u201d\n\nVoter Attitudes\n\nAmerican voters say 73 percent to 21 percent that people brought to the U.S. illegally as children should be allowed to stay and gain legal status, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday, before the shutdown. But there\u2019s risk for Democrats: A CNN poll Friday showed that Americans don\u2019t support a shutdown over the issue -- 56 percent said avoiding a shutdown is more important, while 34 percent said finding a solution for the DACA program should take priority.\n\nRepublicans are conflicted on immigration. Trump, who has promised to build a wall on the southern U.S. border and had directed tougher enforcement on immigration laws, has talked about his compassion for the dreamers. During a meeting with lawmakers Jan. 9 at the White House, he said legislation to protect them \u201cshould be a bill of love.\u201d\n\nProposal Rejected\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the leading Republican proponents of immigration legislation, has been nudging Trump for months on the issue. He\u2019s been a golf partner and offered the president public praise after being one of his leading critics during the campaign.\n\nBut when Graham offered up legislation to resolve the DACA dispute, co-sponsored with Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, Trump rejected it. Graham was one of four Republican senators to vote against letting a Republican temporary funding plan advance to the Senate floor.\n\nGOP leaders refuse to vote on that issue for fear of angering the anti-immigration part of their base unless Trump gets behind a proposal and provides them cover. But the president\u2019s shifting stances have led to paralysis on immigration.\n\nLinkage to Spending\n\nTo Republicans, the original sin of the shutdown was Democrats linking the funding bill to the plight of dreamers, two issues they consider unrelated.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one reason we ended up here: the shoehorning of illegal immigration into this debate,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Saturday on the Senate floor. \u201cNow having said that, there is a lot of sympathy in this body for doing something about the DACA kids.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky Republican conceded that Trump\u2019s views on DACA \u201chave not been made fully apparent yet\u201d as he goes back and forth on what sort of deal he\u2019s willing to accept. But McConnell insisted the government should remain open on a short-term basis while negotiations continue.\n\nDemocrats are skeptical Republicans will ever support the DACA resolution unless forced to, no matter Trump\u2019s shifting positions.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be attached to major spending bills so it makes it to the Oval Office,\u201d Merkley said.\n\nBut that position has only inflamed GOP hardliners.\n\n\u201cBy forcing this government shutdown, Senator Schumer and his colleagues are putting unlawful immigrants before America\u2019s lawful citizens, children, and our troops,\u201d said House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, referring to Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cNo discussions on including DACA in this funding bill should be on the table while Senator Schumer and his allies hold the American people and our government hostage.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are \u201cfixated on amnesty,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican. \u201cI just think this is a manufactured crisis.\u201d", "title": "Hard Lines on Immigration Drove U.S. to a Shutdown Nobody Wanted", "sourceId": "bloomberg", "sourceName": "Bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-21/hard-lines-on-immigration-drove-u-s-to-a-shutdown-nobody-wanted", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T09:00:00Z"}, {"textData": "\n\n\nAfghan official says standoff at Intercontinental Hotel over with all attackers killed, Taliban claim attack.", "title": "Afghan official says standoff at Intercontinental Hotel over with all attackers killed, Taliban claim attack", "sourceId": "abc-news", "sourceName": "ABC News", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/afghan-official-standoff-intercontinental-hotel-attackers-killed-taliban-52498982", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T08:59:56Z"}, {"textData": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sergio Garcia produced a masterful display of bogey-free golf over 27 holes on Sunday to open his season with a five-shot victory at the weather-disrupted Singapore Open, the Spaniard making his move early and dominating from the front.\n\nThe 38-year-old U.S. Masters champion signed for a final-round three-under 68 in glorious sunshine to finish on 14-under 270, well clear of Japan\u2019s Satoshi Kodaira and South Africa\u2019s Shaun Norris, who tied for second on nine-under-par.\n\n\u201cI played nicely but it wasn\u2019t easy.

If he wants to change something, he can, even if it negatively impacts near-term financial results,\" two Macquarie analysts say.\n\n\"As financial analysts, we tend to get a bit concerned when we see vote-controlling CEOs defining what is meaningful and interactive,\" they told clients.\n\nThey rate the stock \"outperform.\"\n\nBut their critique is a reminder that Zuckerberg has a lot of power, and he makes mistakes.\n\n\n\nMark Zuckerberg's control of a majority of Facebook's stock \u2014 which gives him absolute power over the company even though it is publicly traded \u2014 could damage the value of those shares, according to Macquarie Capital analysts Benjamin Schachter and Ed Alter.\n\nThey voiced their opinion after Zuckerberg announced that the priorities of the News Feed in Facebook would change, based on how \"trustworthy\" users believe those sources are.\n\n\"The changes announced by FB should remind investors that Zuckerberg controls the vote and the company. If he wants to change something, he can, even if it negatively impacts near-term financial results,\" the pair told clients on January 17, in a note seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"It is concerning to us that Zuckerberg\u2019s focus is defined by 'meaningful social interactions' that are more interactive and less passive. There is much to admire in this focus, but as financial analysts, we tend to get a bit concerned when we see vote-controlling CEOs defining what is meaningful and interactive,\" Schacter and Alter said. It is relatively rare for equity analysts to criticise Zuckerberg, given the stock's meteoric rise.\n\nIn one sense, they are merely restating the obvious: Zuckerberg has long retained majority control of the stock, and has litigated and maneuvered to maintain that control even as he spends less time running the company on a day-to-day basis. So the note isn't a huge surprise.\n\nBut it is also a restatement of the fact that under Zuckerberg, Facebook has made mistakes. Most recently, in late 2016, Zuckerberg dismissed as \"crazy\" the idea that fake news propagated by Russian agents could have had an impact on the US presidential election that year. More recently, however, Facebook has admitted that 126 million people saw paid Russian propaganda on the social network before the election.\n\nThis latest announcement by Zuckerberg is an attempt to course-correct for the apparent ease with which disreputable media publishers can game the News Feed algorithm, and drive up bogus news inside your Facebook account.\n\nZuckerberg has long been obsessed with news inside Facebook. In 2013, he announced a redesign of the News Feed by saying, \"What we're trying to do is give everyone in the world the best personalized newspaper we can.\" He encapsulated that vision with an illustration of a mock local newspaper called the Monterey Times. In 2014, he tried again, launching a news-only app called Paper.\n\nCrucially, Zuck's vision for that \"newspaper\" has been local, personal, and relevant. His misreading of the scale of Russian influence in the 2016 election, and this latest move to quash fake news, suggests that he has a distaste for national, international or political news in the News Feed.\n\nThe Macquarie analysts \u2014 who rate FB as \"outperform\" \u2014 wrote:\n\n\"Again, we admire much of what he is doing, but from a purely near-term financial view, the headlines of the past year regarding social media\u2019s influence on society increases non-financial risks for FB, and these moves by Zuckerberg highlight that risk.\"\n\n\"... Zuckerberg plainly stated he expects time spent and some measurements of engagement will go down, but believes the changes will be good for the community and the business over the long-term.\"\n\n\"... It\u2019s Zuck\u2019s world, we all just post in it \u2013 This is also a casual reminder that when it comes to sweeping changes on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg is realistically the only one with a say in the matter. As of FB\u2019s most recent proxy statement last year, Zuckerberg holds 59.7% of the voting power in the company. Investors with a differing opinion have little recourse. GOOGL has a somewhat similar situation with Larry Page and Sergey Brin holding 51.1% of the vote, as well as Eric Schmidt with another 5.6%. However, the same isn\u2019t true across all large cap tech and social media, with none of the executives at AAPL, AMZN, or TWTR having full control of the vote. While we think that this change at Facebook is unlikely to stir much serious debate on the matter, it does serve as a reminder of the reality of the situation.\"", "title": "Zuckerberg's control of Facebook may be a threat to the value of the stock, Macquarie says (FB)", "sourceId": "business-insider", "sourceName": "Business Insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/zuckerberg-control-of-facebook-threat-to-value-of-stock-macquarie-2018-1", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T08:52:00Z"}, {"textData": "DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - European leaders will be out in force at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week to defend multilateralism before U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to deliver his \u201cAmerica First\u201d message.\n\nPoliticians, business chiefs, bankers and celebrities will meet in the Swiss Alps under the banner \u201cCreating a Shared Future in a Fractured World\u201d for the four-day gathering against an unsettling global backdrop.\n\nA decade after the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers helped trigger a global financial crisis, economic growth has returned and stock markets are hitting record highs.\n\nYet there is a nagging fear among many in Davos that the brighter economic outlook could turn out to be little more than a mirage if the daunting array of geopolitical threats - from protectionism and climate change to cyber attacks and outright war - gather pace in 2018.\n\n\u201cNot all geopolitical threats are threats to financial markets,\u201d Axel Weber, the chairman of Swiss bank UBS and former president of the German Bundesbank told Reuters. \u201cBut I agree that there may be a disconnect, which has been going on for some time already and may well continue for some time.\u201d\n\nThe Global Risks Report published by the WEF last week showed that many see a heightened risk of political and economic confrontations between major powers this year.\n\nTrump, the first sitting U.S. president to attend the forum since Bill Clinton in 2000, is a source of much of this anxiety after a volatile first year in office in which he has turned American foreign policy on its head.\n\nThe forum will open on Tuesday with a speech by India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and end on Friday, when Trump is due to address the massive auditorium where Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke last year, offering to fill the global leadership void created by an inward-looking Washington.\n\nWhite House officials said over the weekend that a government shutdown in the United States was unlikely to prevent Trump from making the trip, although the budget director Mick Mulvaney said it was now \u201cin flux\u201d.\n\nIn the days between Modi and Trump, the leaders of Europe\u2019s biggest countries, absent from Davos last year and emboldened by their own economic recovery, will offer an alternative vision to Trump and Xi, who the Europeans say has failed to deliver on his promise of a year ago to open China up to foreign investment.\n\nEUROPE\u2018S NEW STAR\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump prepares to address the annual March for Life rally, taking place on the National Mall, from the White House Rose Garden in Washington, U.S., January 19, 2018.

Some of their dishes have been on the restaurants' menus from day one. Others are personal favourites of the chefs, and more still earned their spot by being a hit with the customers. At the time of publication, only 23 restaurants in the UK have two or three Michelin stars. Scroll on to discover the one dish to try from every Michelin two- and three-starred restaurant in the UK, ranked in alphabetical order and including the price for and a description of each dish. (N.B. Prices for meals and set menus don't include wine.) View As: One Page Slides\n\nHalibut, oyster, and seaweed at Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester in Mayfair, London \u2014 three Michelin stars Tomato, garlic, cuttlefish, tripe, thyme, veal stock, and white wine make up this ultimate comfort food. Served with a herb salad, and a slice of cake to mop up the juices, this gratin holds many fond memories for Bosi whose grandma used to cook it for the whole family. \"It's a dish I cook myself at the restaurant as there isn't a recipe for it!\" Bosi said.

That promise is unfulfilled.\n\nGovernments are not going to stand idly by while people replace or abandon fiat currency.\n\nThat's why cryptocurrencies will always be weak credit tokens compared to cash \u2014 governments may be annoying but they aren't stupid.\n\n\n\nThe total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stood at $531 billion just before the weekend, down from $830 billion at it's peak. That's a drop of about 36% in less than a month \u2014 a collapse that qualifies as a market crash.\n\nPeople are casting around for an explanation. Why should this wildly popular new form of payment exchange, which feels like the future, suddenly drop in value? There are a large number of good reasons to sell bitcoin. And that's part of the problem \u2014 on most days it feels like there are more reasons to sell than to buy.\n\nBut the most obvious headwind comes from governments.\n\nRussia, South Korea, China, Algeria, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan have all outright banned bitcoin or made noises about tightening regulation around crypto that would make owning the currency much less attractive. South Korea is moving toward an outright ban even though 10% of the entire bitcoin market is traded in South Korean won, according to Coin Hills.\n\nLast week, the European Securities & Markets Authority said it might consider banning contracts-for-difference based on cryptos.\n\nGovernments are testing one of bitcoin's central promises: That the alt-currency is somehow immune to regulation because it offers uncrackable security with total anonymity. In theory, cryptocurrency enthusiasts will tell you, crypto allows you to hoard staggering wealth and the government can't touch it. (That's why criminals like it so much.)\n\nIt's a nice dream but it requires you to believe that governments will stand idly by while people abandon fiat currency. The government is not going to sit on its hands while people figure out how to stop paying taxes on both their income and capital gains because they are accepting payments via crypto. That would be insane. If there is one thing that governments are good at doing, it's making sure the government never goes away.\n\nOf course the government wants to tax your bitcoin earnings. Of course the government isn't going to let you pay taxes in bitcoin (it's going to require real currency).\n\nIt's not just about creaming off the tax, or making sure the government can see how you earn money.\n\nIt's about the basis of civil society itself.\n\nMoney \u2014 fiat currency \u2014 underpins everything. Literally, everything.\n\nGovernments only stay in business because they have the power to control how much cash flows through the economy. They can create new money or reduce the amount in circulation. Their interest-rate-setting powers control the cost of everything, from the price of patching a pothole in the street to the cost of war in the Middle East.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies came even remotely close to becoming the preferred form of cash, then governments would be out of business. The idea that The Man is going abdicate that power to software? Dream on.\n\nBitcoin will lose this battle.\n\nGovernments will move more slowly than tech, sure. But eventually, they will wrestle control of crypto. At that point cryptocurrencies become mere credit tokens valued in actual cash.

Created after World War II, the NHS provides free health care to all U.K. residents.\n\nBut even before Britons voted to leave the European Union, the financially strapped NHS was beset by workforce shortages. It has long relied on foreigners to fill its ranks, with around 5 percent of its staff coming from Europe.\n\nNow Brexit \u2014 Britain's departure from the 28-country bloc in March 2019 \u2014 is making matters worse, particularly among general practitioners.\n\nThe NHS is so beloved that part of the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympic Games paid tribute to its workers. Jae C. Hong / AP, file\n\nThe fall in the value of the pound and the perception that Britain is less welcoming to foreigners has made both recruiting and retaining European staff a challenge. Many E.U. citizens living in the U.K. not only feel rejected but are wary about what the future may hold for their status as immigrants.\n\n\u201cThis is our home. We are not here as tourists,\" said Hubertus von Blumenthal, a general practitioner from Germany who is based just outside Cambridge. \"With the referendum that all changed. We woke up in the morning and it felt like the rug was pulled from under us.\"\n\nVon Blumenthal, 56, has lived in the U.K. for as long as he did in Germany. He arrived at 28 to work as a doctor, but is now planning to retire early from the NHS and is looking for a job in Germany, Switzerland or Luxembourg.\n\nBritain came to a draft agreement with the E.U. in December that the rights of the 3 million E.U. citizens living in the U.K. will be enshrined in law and enforced by British courts. Details of the plan are unclear, however, and von Blumenthal for one remains suspicious.\n\n'Bargaining chip'\n\nHe said he would make a final decision on whether to move in the next year, before Brexit negotiations are likely to conclude.\n\n\"I have no confidence or trust whatsoever [in the government] and feel as much a bargaining chip now as before,\" he said, adding that his wife recently found a job with a company with an office in Germany so the family can relocate more easily.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone in his deliberations. According to a survey of doctors from E.U. countries working in the U.K. taken by the British Medical Association, 45 percent are considering leaving. Another 18 percent have already made plans to leave.\n\nA hospital in London. WILL OLIVER / EPA\n\n\u201cI have been working and living here for 23 years, paying taxes, and all of a sudden I\u2019m getting told I might have to apply for a work visa, or jump through flaming hoops to stay for a limited time,\u201d said Andreas Herfurt, a 53-year-old GP in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nHe came to Britain in 1994 from Mainz, Germany, and is considering moving back, depending on how the Brexit negotiations work out.\n\nThe potential loss of such doctors threatens to put even more pressure on a health service that is already understaffed. Prime Minister Theresa May was recently forced to apologize to tens of thousands of patients whose operations were canceled to free up staff and beds to deal with emergency patients.\n\nAbout one-third of government spending on public services is spent on health, but the pressure from tight budgets, an aging population and increasingly complex medical needs have left many hospitals struggling.\n\nRelated: Professionals Wave Goodbye to U.K., Head to Europe\n\nThere are currently the equivalent of 33,300 full-time general practitioners in the country. And by 2020, more than 12,000 additional GPs will be needed in England, according to an analysis by Imperial College London.\n\nThe government aims to recruit 5,000 GPs over the next two years \u2014 including 2,000 from overseas. But only 38 non-U.K. nationals signed up during the first six months of 2017, according to figures published in The BMJ, a medical journal.\n\nIt\u2019s not only doctors that are in short supply across the NHS. The Royal College of Nursing has estimated that there are around 40,000 unfilled nursing positions in England alone.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be like this. In the lead-up to the referendum, campaigners for leaving the E.U. insisted that Brexit would benefit the NHS \u2014 to the tune of \u00a3350 million ($473.7 million) a week.\n\nThe promise was even plastered on the side of the \"Leave\" campaign\u2019s red bus that toured the country.\n\nThe \"Leave\" campaign's bus advertisements promoted their claim that the NHS would save \u00a3350 million a week by leaving the E.U. Jack Taylor / Getty Images\n\nReality, though, has proven less lucrative: The Financial Times newspaper estimated that the vote to leave has now cost the U.K. around \u00a3350 million a week.\n\nDuring the Brexit campaign, Europeans were frequently accused of overburdening the health service as patients, with the Conservative government even introducing a new policy to crack down on so-called health tourism that it claimed could recoup up to \u00a3500 million ($676 million). The British Medical Association described that figure as \"exaggerated\" and \"unreliable.\"\n\nWhile workforce pressures may be the highest-profile health sector consequence of Brexit, it\u2019s not the only one.\n\nResearch, regulation, medicines, medical devices and reciprocal health care agreements are all areas where U.K. and E.U. organizations and institutions not only collaborate but depend on each other.\n\nA doctor at a hospital in Birmingham, England.

Well, maybe, briefly.\n\nOPEC ministers and friends meeting in Doha today to assess their output deal would be wise not to get too carried away.\n\nThe IEA, as I noted last week, is much less bullish about demand growth in the coming months than other pundits. For some, this raises the risk that the world's most-watched forecast significantly underestimates oil use and, as a result, the speed of oil market rebalancing and the upward pressure on prices.\n\nBroad-based economic recovery is setting the world up for demand growth of 1.7 million barrels a day in 2018, and there's a chance that it could be as high as 2 million barrels, according to Energy Aspects. Certainly there's a lot of expansion about -- the World Bank has raised its global GDP growth forecast for this year to 3.1 percent from the 2.9 percent it projected in June. With strong economic momentum in almost every country and region, there is \"no real drag on oil demand growth,\" Energy Aspects said Jan. 15.\n\nBounding Ahead The World Bank has raised its 2018 forecast of real global GDP growth to the highest in seven years Source: World Bank\n\nBut there could be one in the works. Rising prices can have a chilling effect on demand growth, and benchmark crude prices have risen more than 55 percent since their rally started in June. End-user retail prices are feeling this.\n\nU.S. gasoline and diesel are both the most expensive they have been at this time of year since 2014 and, in contrast to the normal seasonal pattern, pump prices are already rising.

Drivers are unlikely to benefit from similar price moves this year.\n\nWhat happens to car owners in rich nations isn't the only source of strain on demand. Many developing countries took the opportunity of the sharp fall in prices to reduce subsidies on oil products, which could amplify the impact of higher crude on what end users pay.\n\nAnd some less-developed countries are shifting to natural gas from oil. The IEA sees 540,000 barrels a day of demand for gasoil, fuel oil and crude displaced by gas in five non-OECD countries since 2014. Saudi Arabia has also cut its direct crude use for power generation by around 100,000 barrels a day in the past two years. The displacement theme will continue this year.\n\nThe draw on global stockpiles should resume in the second quarter, even amid rising OPEC output, according to Energy Aspects.\n\nThe IEA also sees a big rise in oil production this year, including \"explosive growth\" in the U.S. With the pickup in non-OPEC supply exceeding the increase in demand, it sees the world's need for OPEC production falling by around 600,000 barrels a day compared with last year, to a level below last month's output. The implication of that for prices is clear -- if the IEA is right, the possibility that oil reaches $100 a barrel is remote.\n\nShrinking Market The IEA sees non-OPEC supply growing more than global oil demand in 2018, leaving less room for OPEC crude Sources: Bloomberg, International Energy Agency\n\nHigher prices may yet clip the wings of the oil demand growth that OPEC and friends need.

That's right \u2014 every fighter in the final four is undefeated. With 57 knockouts between them, they all pack a punch, too.\n\nWBO cruiserweight world champion Oleksandr Usyk and WBC belt holder Mairis Breidis will contest the first semi-final on January 27 in Latvia. The following weekend will see IBF world titlist Murat Gassiev and WBA ruler Yunier Dorticos trade blows in Russia.\n\nWhen Business Insider first spoke to Kalle Sauerland last year, he tipped Usyk for success. He even told us that he ran a poll that showed 82% of people had picked Usyk to \"win the whole thing.\"\n\nUsyk blasted past Marco Huck, the greatest and most decorated cruiserweight since David Haye, in a tenth round quarter-final slaughter last September.\n\nYou can watch the highlights right here:\n\n#TBT to Usyk stopping Huck in our opening quarter-final in September! \ud83d\udca5\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Date, venue & ticket news for #UsykBriedis coming soon!\n\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f Sign-up for Ticket Alerts here: https://t.co/oredfUincr\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 #AliTrophy pic.twitter.com/xSiwWby9Rt \u2014 WBSuperSeries (@WBSuperSeries) November 30, 2017\n\nUsyk's thumping victory enhanced his tag as favourite. However, Sauerland argues that the other fighters also excelled en route to the semi-final stage.\n\n\"Usyk is an Olympic, European, and world champion boxer,\" Sauerland recently told BI. \"And he was a world champion after very few fights as a pro. He's an absolute superstar but has unknown quantities. The other guys don't as they have come through and passed tough examinations.\n\n\"Breidis, Gassiev, and Dorticos all enjoyed strong performances or strong knockouts in the quarter-finals. The way Gassiev dispatched Krzysztof W\u0142odarczyk, who has been many times world champion, was brutal! Dorticos was also frightening [against Dmitry Kudryashov in the quarter final].\"\n\nDorticos' crushing second round win over Kudrashov can be seen here:\n\nThis is great...

Even Gassiev had to dig deep before he entered the World Boxing Super Series as he overcame Denis Lebedev for the IBF cruiserweight world title in 2016.\"\n\nThe World Boxing Super Series champion will make history\n\nEvery fighter in the semi-final is a world champion. Each semi-final winner will annex the loser's belt. The final will therefore see two double cruiserweight champions fight each other.\n\nNo fighter in the history of cruiserweight boxing has held all four of the major titles at the same time, but the World Boxing Super Series winner will do just that. The winner will have won all of the major world title belts, the World Boxing Super Series title (the Ali Trophy), multi-millions of dollars, and will have secured a massive legacy.\n\n\"The overall winner will have cleared out the entire cruiserweight division,\" Sauerland told Business Insider.\n\nSo, having vanquished a who's who list of elite cruiserweights, what could possibly be next for the undisputed world champion?\n\nAs the cruiserweight limit is 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms) it is not too big of a leap to move to heavyweight (no weight limit) just like elite fighters like David Haye and Evander Holyfield have done in previous decades.\n\nHere, a massively profitable fight against the self-styled Gypsy King Tyson Fury, American knockout artist Deontay Wilder, or world champion Anthony Joshua could be made in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nIs that what is in store for Usyk, Breidis, Gassiev, or Dorticos? Is the eventual World Boxing Super Series champion a future opponent for Joshua?\n\n\"Breidis has already fought at heavyweight,\" Sauerland explained, a nod to the fact that it could well be on the cards. \"Everybody's talking about Usyk stepping up to heavyweight. These are big, big guys but Joshua is an even bigger guy.\n\n\"If it is Usyk who steps up he can rely upon his technical ability. The others, the punchers, all have that punch [that can vanquish an opponent] and can follow former champions like Haye and Holyfield who successfully stepped up to heavyweight in the past.\"\n\nRegardless of future endeavours, Sauerland argues that the World Boxing Super Series champion will have secured a clear legacy. \"Whoever wins the World Boxing Super Series is automatically a legend.\"\n\nA 'Champions League-style product' for boxing\n\nThe World Boxing Super Series champion will become \"a legend\" because it's rare when fighters unify all of the four major championships. At cruiserweight, it has never been done.\n\nThe fragmented nature of world championship boxing means that the WBO, WBA, WBC, and IBF world titles could be held by four separate fighters, like it currently is at cruiserweight.\n\nUnification fights, when two world champions meet in one fight, are uncommon. However, Sauerland's tournament has broken ground as it has forced participants into an easy-to-follow competition format.\n\nSauerland thinks the World Boxing Super Series is the closest thing boxing has to the UEFA Champions League in football.\n\nHe may be right. After all, the calibre of fighters involved, combined with the high-quality production Sauerland has overseen from each show, has seen him increase visibility of the product into twice as many territories.\n\n\"We have deals where we are visible in 150 different countries,\" Sauerland said. \"This is up from 60 to 90 from the first event [the Usyk v. Huck quarter final last year].\n\n\"We've grown TV deals in a very good eight figure region. We're talking millions. But we have gone for a soft line on sponsoring.\"\n\nConsidering there is $50 million in prize money at stake, combined with production costs on a fight-to-fight basis, it seems surprising that Sauerland has gone for a \"soft line\" in sponsorship rather than seek at least eight deals, which is the norm in the wider combat sports industry.\n\n\"We are not looking for classic partnership but strategic partnerships, And have been in advanced discussions with two or three big companies,\" he said. \"We want to retain the feel we have. The look and feel of the ring-walks, the productions, the shows. So we're doing that strategically, rather than having 15 different emblems plastered across our brand.\n\n\"This is more in line with a Champions League style product.\"\n\nLike the Champions League in football, the World Boxing Super Series has brought together multiple champions from a number of divisions/countries.\n\nFrom next weekend, we'll have a greater idea of who will be the one to lift the Ali Trophy at the end of the season.", "title": "The winner of this $50 million boxing tournament will go on to fight Anthony Joshua, become incredibly rich, and achieve something no cruiserweight has done before", "sourceId": "business-insider", "sourceName": "Business Insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-cruiserweight-world-boxing-super-series-winner-will-make-history-and-be-a-future-anthony-joshua-opponent-2018-1", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T07:31:00Z"}, {"textData": "\n\n\nTurkish troops and Syrian opposition forces attacked a Kurdish enclave in northern Syria on Sunday in their bid to drive a U.S.-allied Kurdish militia from the region.\n\nTurkish officials said the troops entered Afrin a day after dozens of Turkish jets and artillery units at the border pounded Syrian Kurdish targets. A spokesman for the Kurdish fighters said the attack was repelled.\n\nTurkey considers the Syrian Kurdish militia, known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, a terror organization and a security threat because of its affiliation to Kurdish rebels fighting in southeastern Turkey.\n\nThe group controls Afrin, in Syria's northwestern Aleppo province, as well as a swath of territory to the east along Turkey's border. The YPG also forms the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main U.S. ally against the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said the Turkish-backed fighters had penetrated 5 kilometers (3 miles) into Afrin as part of the offensive, codenamed Olive Branch.\n\nIn a statement, the Syrian opposition fighters battling alongside the Turkish troops said the combined force seized Shankal, a village on the northwestern edge of Afrin district.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali denied that Turkish troops had entered Afrin, saying Kurdish forces had been repelling attacks since Saturday. Bali said the SDF had sent reinforcements to Afrin.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the Kurdish militia and Turkish forces have clashed on the northern and western edges of Afrin. The Observatory said the Turkey-backed forces have entered Shankal and are clashing with the Kurds.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to expand the offensive to Manbij, a town to the east that Kurdish forces seized from the Islamic State group in a costly battle with the aid of the U.S.-led coalition. The town has since emerged as a model for U.S.-backed Kurdish rule of largely Arab areas.\n\nAn advance on Manbij by NATO member Turkey would pit two close U.S. allies against one another, adding another front to the already complex Syrian civil war.\n\nTurkish troops first crossed into Syria after the Kurds captured Manbij in 2016, in part to prevent them from expanding westward and linking up to Afrin. At least 70 Turkish soldiers have been killed since then, most in battles with the Islamic State group, which has since been driven from nearly all the territory it once held in Syria.\n\nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim told a group of journalists on Sunday that Turkey aims to create a 30-kilometer (20-mile) deep \"secure zone\" in Afrin, according to Turkish media reports. He told reporters that there were between 8,000 and 10,000 \"terrorists\" in Afrin.\n\nEarlier Sunday, four rockets fired from Syria hit the Turkish border town of Kilis, prompting Turkish artillery to return fire, Gov. Mehmet Tekinarslan said. The rockets hit two houses and a workplace, and slightly wounded one person.\n\nAssociated Press journalists on the border saw a convoy of trucks, believed to belong to Syrian opposition fighters, carrying pick-up trucks mounted with arms. Artillery shelling could be heard in the distance.\n\nTurkey has prepared around 10,000 Syrian fighters to storm Afrin, according Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group.\n\nA Syrian commander speaking to the AP by phone from northern Syria said there were thousands of fighters positioned in Azaz, at the frontier with the Kurdish enclave, awaiting orders. Another commander said hundreds more were stationed in Atmeh, south of Afrin. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nTurkish leaders were infuriated by an announcement by the U.S. military this week that it was going to create a 30,000-strong border force with the Kurdish fighters to secure northern Syria. Days later, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that the U.S. would maintain a military presence with the Kurds for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.

Germany\u2019s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) will decide on Sunday whether to start formal coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives, a move which would bring Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse one step closer to a stable government.\n\nSPD leader Martin Schulz is facing a strong backlash from the party\u2019s left and youth wings, which argue that the SPD should reinvent itself in opposition after scoring its worst election result in September since Germany became a federal republic in 1949.\n\nAround 600 delegates, meeting in Bonn, will debate and vote on whether their leaders should push ahead with coalition talks on renewing an alliance with Merkel\u2019s conservatives that took office in 2013.\n\nThe two blocs, which both bled support to the far right in the Sept. 24 election, struck a preliminary deal last week but critics, including the party\u2019s youth wing leader Kevin Kuehnert, say the agreed blueprint does not bear enough of the SPD\u2019s hallmarks.\n\nSunday\u2019s vote will also be watched closely abroad as Germany has Europe\u2019s largest economy and Merkel has long played a leading role in the continent\u2019s economic and security affairs.\n\nSenior Social Democrats have cited progress in efforts to win support for formal talks after the SPD\u2019s biggest regional branch in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) recommended its members vote in favour of entering negotiations - on condition that Schulz push for more concessions on labour, health and migration policies.\n\nSPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles said she expected formal talks to happen. \u201cNevertheless, I ask everyone in my party to take responsibility: Please consider the consequences if this government option fails,\u201d she told Welt am Sonntag.\n\nMartin Schulz, leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), inspects the convention hall prior to the SPD's one-day party congress under the slogan \"New times need new politics\" in Bonn, Germany, January 20, 2018.

Their agreement on supply cuts, originally launched last January, is due to expire in December this year.\n\nKhalid al-Falih, speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting later in the day of the joint ministerial committee which oversees implementation of the cuts, said extending cooperation would convince the world that coordination among producers was \u201chere to stay\u201d.\n\n\u201dWe shouldn\u2019t limit our efforts to 2018 - we need to be talking about a longer framework of cooperation,\u201c Falih said. \u201dI am talking about extending the framework that we started, which is the declaration of cooperation, beyond 2018.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean sticking barrel by barrel to the same limits or cuts, or production targets country by country that we signed up to in 2016, but assuring stakeholders, investors, consumers and the global community that this is something that is here to stay. And we are going to work together.\u201d\n\nFalih said the global economy had strengthened while supply cuts - in which Saudi Arabia has shouldered by far the largest burden - had shrunk oil inventories around the world. As a result, the oil market will return to balance in 2018, he said.\n\nBut he said producers still had a lot of hard work ahead to restore the market to health, and it was unlikely to reach balance by the middle of this year.\n\nFalih and energy ministers from the United Arab Emirates and Oman noted that the rise of the Brent oil price to three-year highs around $70 a barrel in recent weeks could cause an increase in supply of shale oil from the United States.\n\nBut both Falih and UAE minister Suhail al-Mazroui said they did not think the rise in prices would hurt global demand for oil.\n\nKuwait\u2019s oil minister Bakheet al-Rashidi said any discussion among producers on the future of the agreement on supply cuts would not occur on Sunday, but was expected to happen at a meeting in June. OPEC and other producers led by Russia are next scheduled to meet to discuss oil policy in June.\n\nOman\u2019s oil minister Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhi said producers would discuss in November whether to renew their supply agreement or enter a new type of agreement.

In addition to filling in for his father at a high-dollar fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach, Fla., the 34-year old also went on Fox News Channel's \"Judge Jeanine,\" to defend the president's accomplishments.\n\nBetween accolades for his father, the younger Trump stumbled over a basic rule of politics: Never boast about how you will benefit politically from the misfortune of your constituents.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing for us,\" Eric Trump said of the government shutdown that was triggered at midnight on Friday by the failure of congressional negotiators and the Trump White House to reach a deal to fund the government. The public, Eric Trump said, would blame Democrats for the paralysis in Washington, and for the forced furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal employees, who would be sent home without pay.\n\nYet even if this prediction came true \u2013 and recent polling suggests otherwise \u2013 it could be seen as a stumble at a politically fraught time for his father and Republican lawmakers.\n\nTo be sure, Eric Trump is not the sort of experienced politician who might be expected to navigate situations like these with traditional savvy. But neither is he the disinterested outsider that he promised to be in late 2016, as his father prepared to take office.\n\nIn March 2017, weeks after the elder Trump's inauguration, Eric Trump was still describing a \"clear separation of church and state\" between his father's political career and the Trump Organization, the family real estate business that he and his brother Donald Trump Jr. are managing while their father is president. Yet almost from the start, both Eric and Donald Jr. have served as outspoken political advocates for the president and his policies.\n\nSaturday offered a perfect example of this ongoing tension. By calling in to Jeanine Pirro's show a little after 9 p.m. ET, Eric Trump was serving as a both a de facto White House surrogate on prime-time TV and as a stand-in for his father at a gala fundraiser for Trump's reelection campaign.\n\nWhether Eric Trump's boast will turn into a headache for the Trump White House remains to be seen. And it wasn't the only miscalculation he made on Saturday night.\n\nDuring Saturday's call-in with Pirro, Eric Trump sought to explain why Democrats deserve the blame for the current shutdown by highlighting how many Democrats voted against a bill to fund the government.\n\n\"If you looked at the vote, you had 269 Republicans who voted to keep the government open. And you had 230 Democrats who voted to close government,\" he said, \"and they'll say Trump wanted to close the government. ... It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And I'm pretty good at math.\"\n\nYet in the House, 230 Republicans voted for the measure, while in the Senate, 45 did, for a total of 275 GOP votes \u2013 not 269, as Trump claimed.

When a guard informed said he could only enter using the main entrance, he decided to make his way home.\n\nHowever, a gang of five CasaPound supporters was waiting at his car.\n\nRecognising one of the young men as a former classmate, Gianelli asked what they were doing at his car.\n\n\"Then he hit me, and I fell,\" he says.\n\nWithin seconds of hitting the pavement, kicks and punches thudded against Gianelli's sides as he put his hands up to protect his head.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nHis attackers left him on the ground with his lips busted, a mouth full of blood and three broken ribs.\n\n\"Go tell the police now,\" they said, mocking him.\n\nBorn as a political movement in 2003, when far-rightists occupied a vacant municipal building in central Rome, CasaPound's name is an ode to the American poet Ezra Pound, who was a supporter of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini.\n\n'A controlled form of neo-fascism'\n\nIn November, CasaPound clenched around 6,000 votes of the vote in Ostia's municipal elections - a nearly 600 percent increase from the previous vote a few years earlier.\n\nIts newfound success in Ostia came on the heels of the party securing eight percent of the votes in Lucca's mayoral elections in June and recently landing its members on city councils in nearby Todi and the northern city of Bolzano.\n\nWith CasaPound's Luca Marsella, a vocal fascist who has been accused of violent threats, now a district councilor in Ostia, the elections have prompted fear among political opponents and analysts who worry about the return of fascism in a country that toiled for 21 years under Mussolini's rule.\n\nGuido Caldiron, a Rome-based journalist and author of Extreme Right, a book that examines the growth of the far right in Europe and elsewhere, says the electoral results in Ostia are \"very important because Rome is CasaPound's core. For them, it's a very significant victory\".\n\nDescribing a \"militarised entity\" whose supporters simultaneously carry out attacks while the party's brass denies any affiliation with bloodshed, Caldiron tells Al Jazeera: \"Even when they are involved in violence, they always try to cover it.\"\n\nThe efforts at protecting its brand and presenting a respectable face to the public, Caldiron argues, distinguishes CasaPound from other far-right groups that openly celebrate violence against anti-fascists and migrants.\n\n\"They have people who are legitimate criminals, and they have to control that - it's a controlled form of neo-fascism,\" he explains.\n\n\"You can be violent, but you have to accept certain rules and not show off about your violence \u2026 It is all part of a package designed to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of respectability.\"\n\nDeadly and dangerous attacks\n\nDespite regularly denying violence, CasaPound's members and supporters have a lengthy history of attacks.\n\nIn December 2011, a 50-year-old CasaPound supporter in Florence shot dead two Senegalese street traders and injured three others before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide.\n\nCasaPound activist Alberto Palladino has been sentenced to two years in prison over an attack that hospitalised five activists from the centre-left Democratic Party that same year. The party claims that he was wrongfully convicted.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nMore recently, as locals in Ostia geared up to cast their ballots in November, local mob affiliate Roberto Spada head-butted and struck with a pipe reporter Daniele Piervincenzi when the journalist asked about his support for CasaPound.\n\nSpada had previously proclaimed in a Facebook post.\n\nThe incident was caught on tape and led to national outcry.\n\nCasaPound subsequently attempted to distance itself from the Spada Clan, a local mafia network active in Ostia.\n\n'If there were no anti-fascists, there'd be no violence'\n\nOn a chilly morning in early January, a self-described \"militant\" opens the door of CasaPound's squat in central Rome. Inside, he points to the walls of the corridor, which are colourfully painted with the names of the party's heroes.\n\nMussolini and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whose work was glorified by both Italian and German fascists, are honoured.\n\nLess explicable are names such as Ahmad Shah Massoud, the late Afghan militia leader who battled the Soviets and the Taliban alike, and Jack Kerouac, the American novelist and pioneer of the Beat Generation literary movement.\n\nSimone Di Stefano, CasaPound's prime ministerial candidate in the upcoming national elections in March, insists that the party's gains in Ostia are important in an area \"that has been abandoned by the state\" that has been unfairly branded as a \"mafia city\".\n\nSwaddled in a black winter coat, Di Stefano runs his hand through his short, grey-peppered hair. He sits in a conference room.\n\nThe walls are blanketed in party propaganda announcing conferences and celebrating visits by far-right parties from across the Europe.\n\nOne of the posters announces a 2014 meeting between CasaPound and party officials from the Golden Dawn, the neo-fascist party in nearby Greece.\n\nOn an adjacent wall, a framed CasaPound poster brandishes the face of Julius Evola, the Italian philosopher whose work sought to advance fascism.\n\nSince its establishment 14 years ago, CasaPound has opened 106 offices across the country and boasts of 20,000 card-carrying members.\n\nIn recent years, the party broadened its base with increasing success by taking aim at refugees and migrants, capitalising on Euroscepticism and squatting buildings to protest Italy's housing crisis.\n\nWhile leftists and anarchists have for decades occupied buildings for people displaced by evictions and carried out social projects such as distributing food to the poor, CasaPound's cooptation of these tactics come with an important distinction: Italians only.\n\nDi Stefano does not deny its supporters participate in physical confrontation.\n\n\"If there were no anti-fascists, there would be no violence,\" he says.\n\nHe points to an incident in January 2017, when a police officer was injured while attempting to defuse an explosive device outside a CasaPound-linked bookshop in Florence.\n\nReferring to Gianelli, the anti-fascist who claims to have been attacked, he says the accusations are \"lies\", adding that CasaPound has attempted to sue the activist for libel in the past.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nDi Stefano blames the media and anti-fascists for violence, dubbing them as agents of \"globalism\", a term that critics say carries anti-Semitic undertones.\n\n\"There is no actual evidence [of CasaPound] doing physical attacks,\" he claims.\n\nA priest and teenager resolve to fight on\n\nBack in Ostia, local leaders and residents dismiss claims of CasaPound's innocence.\n\nWitnessing the party's rise around him, Franco De Donno, a priest who has lived in the suburb since 1981, decided last Autumn to run in the municipal elections. Now a district councilor, he sits across the table from the fascist party's Marsella in municipal meetings.\n\nExplaining that he was born on June 2, 1946, the day that Italy became a republic, De Donno says: \"Being democratic and anti-fascist is in my DNA.\"\n\nSitting in a cafe on Ostia's main square, De Donno recounts leaving the church after a sermon to find a band of CasaPound members holding up a banner accusing him of being a traitor for his open support of refugees and migrants.\n\nThe priest has helped form a network of solidarity activists and like-minded members of the faith community.\n\n\"If this mentality of exclusion [of migrants and others] continues, there will be no peace and no development,\" he argues, \"but the strongest enemy that needs to be defeated is indifference [to fascism].\"\n\nCarlo*, a 16-year-old Ostia local, smokes a cigarette and drinks espresso at a cafe.\n\nYoung people, he says, should get involved in the anti-fascist movement early on.\n\nHe has been twice assaulted by CasaPound supporters.\n\nDuring the summer of 2017, a CasaPound supporter - an adult male - asked if he had been present in anti-fascist demonstrations in front of the party's offices.\n\n\"What?\" he replied, surprised by the question.\n\nThen a fist crashed into his eye. \"What the f*ck? I didn't do anything,\" Carlo said.\n\nHe decided not to press charges because he did not trust the police department.\n\n\"Then other people started threatening me,\" he explains. \"They said, 'We'll shoot you.'\"\n\nFrom that day on, when CasaPound supporters saw him in the street, they hurled insults and threats in his direction. \"They called me a 'shitty hippie' and a 'communist f*ggot.'.\"\n\nA few months later, when Carlo and his girlfriend were at a pub, a group of seven CasaPound supporters - all adults - called him over to their table. \"What do you think about fascism?\" one of them men asked him.\n\nFearing another attack, Carlo replied simply: \"It's an important part of our country's history.\"\n\nHe remembers: \"I wanted to say, 'Fascism is sh*tty,' but I couldn't.\"\n\nAfter a brief exchange, the man grabbed Carlo by the collar, pulled him close and threatened him.

Strikingly, the public divides evenly on whether or not he\u2019s mentally stable.\n\n\nThat question aside, a lopsided majority, 73 percent of those polled, rejects Trump\u2019s self-assessed genius. Seventy percent say he fails to acquit himself in a way that\u2019s fitting and proper for a president. Two-thirds say he\u2019s harming his presidency with his use of Twitter. And 52 percent see him as biased against blacks -- soaring to 79 percent of blacks themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee PDF for full results, charts and tables.\n\n\nJust 36 percent of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, while 58 percent disapprove, essentially unchanged since midsummer. Next lowest at one year was Gerald Ford\u2019s 45 percent in 1975; average pre-Trump approval -- since Harry Truman\u2019s presidency -- is 63 percent.\n\n\nWomen are especially critical of Trump in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates: A mere 29 percent approve of his work, vs. 44 percent of men. And a remarkable 55 percent of women doubt Trump\u2019s mental stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s signature achievement, the new tax law, is unpopular; 60 percent say it favors the wealthy (even most well-off Americans say so), and the public by a 12-point margin, 46 to 34 percent, says it\u2019s a bad thing for the country. At the same time, a majority celebrates his most prominent failure, on Obamacare; 57 percent say the program\u2019s continuation is a good thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA vast 87 percent support the DACA immigration program that Trump ended and whose fate in Congress is uncertain -- including two-thirds of strong conservatives, three-quarters of evangelical white Protestants and as many Republicans, core Trump groups. And 63 percent overall oppose a U.S.-Mexico border wall, essentially unchanged since before the 2016 election.\n\n\nAs reported Friday, Trump -- and his party leaders -- also are at greater risk in the government shutdown, with Americans 20 points more likely to say they\u2019d blame Trump and the Republicans in Congress than the Democrats in Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a controversy that continues to cloud his presidency, half of Americans think members of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia to try to influence the election. About as many, 49 percent, think Trump himself obstructed justice in the Russia investigation.\n\n\nThat said, far fewer, 26 percent, think there\u2019s been \u201csolid evidence\u201d of obstruction; the rest call it their suspicion only. And approval of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s handling of the investigation has ebbed, from 58 to 50 percent in 11 weeks.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s ratings might be yet worse were it not for sharply improved economic sentiment. Fifty-eight percent say the economy is in good (or even excellent) shape, the most in 17 years. But just 38 percent say the Trump administration deserves credit; many more, 50 percent, credit the Obama administration. It\u2019s axiomatic that a successful economy doesn\u2019t guarantee presidential popularity, it merely makes it possible -- and Trump\u2019s other challenges tie his shoelaces.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s criticism for the Democrats, as well, in their response to Trump\u2019s unpopularity, but it\u2019s eased to some extent. In November, 61 percent of Americans said the Democratic Party\u2019s leaders were criticizing Trump without presenting alternatives; that\u2019s down to 53 percent. However, just 31 percent say the Democrats are offering alternatives, essentially unchanged from 28 percent last fall. Instead, more now are simply unsure.\n\n\nIt\u2019s true, too, that some Trump initiatives, while not popular, are not broadly opposed. Three divide the country about evenly: the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants (46 percent say it\u2019s a good thing for the country, 47 percent a bad thing); reduced business regulations (44-42 percent); and a reduction in the federal workforce (44-43 percent).\n\n\nAmong other results, 60 percent say Trump\u2019s accomplished not much or nothing in his first year; Bill Clinton did as badly on that score, but still ended 1993 with an approval rating that\u2019s 22 points higher than Trump\u2019s today. Most, in another result, say Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t affected their own families, but more say they\u2019ve been hurt (26 percent) than helped (20 percent).\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s gone from 11 points underwater in job approval last spring to 22 points today, a shift that occurred by July and has stabilized since. That\u2019s a vast swing from his 12 predecessors, who averaged 29 points to the positive after a year in the White House.\n\n\nFour previous presidents -- Barack Obama, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Truman \u2013 were at 51 to 53 percent approval after one year; Bill Clinton saw 56 percent and the rest ranged from 63 percent (Richard Nixon) to 83 percent (George W. Bush, after 9/11). Ratings at one year don\u2019t predict a career trajectory. That said, a score in the 30s, this early in a presidency, is uncharted territory.\n\n\nIndeed just six of the past 12 presidents ever went as low or lower in approval as Trump is now -- Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Nixon, Carter and both Bushes -- and all but Truman, much later in their presidencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cstrong\u201d disapprovers, moreover, outnumber his strong approvers by a 2-1 margin. Obama got there as well, but it took him more than two-and-a-half years in office, and a deeply struggling economy.\n\n\nCompared with the first ABC News/Washington Post poll of his presidency, in April, Trump is less popular generally across the board, but especially among college graduates (-11 points, to 31 percent approval), residents of the Northeast and West regions (-9 and -8 points, respectively) and whites -8 points, vs. no change among nonwhites, who started so low).\n\n\n\n\nThere are impressive differences among groups above and beyond the wide gender gap in Trump\u2019s approval. He\u2019s at new lows, 6 and 7 percent approval, respectively, among Democrats and liberals, compared with 80 percent of strong conservatives, 78 percent of Republicans and 68 percent of evangelical white Protestants. (He slips to 59 percent approval among \u201csomewhat\u201d conservatives.)\n\n\nSuch gaps have become a fixture of the sharply divided political firmament. Obama, for example, saw a low of 7 percent approval for Republicans, at the same time (March 2015) that he was at 79 percent among Democrats.\n\n\nPartisan predispositions influence more than job approval. Consider:\n\n\n-- Seventy-nine percent of Democrats think Trump obstructed the Russia investigation, and 51 percent of independents agree \u2013 diving to just 13 percent of Republicans.\n\n\n-- Seventy-five percent of Democrats think Trump is not mentally stable. Forty-six percent of independents share that view. Just 14 percent of Republicans agree. (Party and ideology aside, Trump is most likely to be seen as stable by white evangelicals, 79 percent, and non-college-educated white men, 69 percent; and most likely to be seen as not stable by nonwhites, including two-thirds of blacks and Hispanics alike.)\n\n\n-- Fifty percent of Republicans say Trump\u2019s a genius. That plummets in other groups -- 17 percent of independents, 6 percent of Democrats. There\u2019s also a notable division within conservative ranks on the question. Among people who are strongly conservative, 52 percent call Trump a genius, while among \u201csomewhat\u201d conservatives, this drops to just 29 percent.\n\n\n\n\nThere are notable differences among groups on substantive issues as well. Fifty-eight percent of whites call the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants a good thing for the country; just 26 percent of nonwhites -- including 18 percent of Hispanics -- agree. Or, looking at two key voting groups in 2016, 74 percent of non-college-educated white men say it\u2019s a good thing, compared with 39 percent of college-educated white women.\n\n\nThen there\u2019s the tax bill. Among Americans on the lower half of the income scale, 26 percent call it a good thing for the country, compared with 41 percent of those with middle incomes or more. Even in those middle and higher ranges, though, there\u2019s only a division on whether the bill is a good thing or bad thing -- 41-43 percent in the $50,000 to $100,000 bracket, and about the same, 40-43 percent, in the $100,000-plus range (about two in 10 adults).\n\n\nOne last finding cuts to a telling example of general agreement, rather than disagreement, and again not to Trump\u2019s advantage. Among lower-income Americans, 64 percent say the tax bill favors the wealthy. And among the comparatively wealthy themselves, those with $100,000-plus incomes, 56 percent say the same thing.\n\n\n\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Jan. 15-18, 2018, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults.

Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nThe crossing symbolizes Europe\u2019s past and present, though the question troubling Pan is what it will mean for the future.\n\nItalian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler cemented their partnership in World War II here. As the European Union helped foster postwar peace, customs and immigration checks melted away. Now the busiest pass through the Alps encapsulates what\u2019s shaping up as the continent\u2019s defining challenge in 2018: Should governments respond to the frustrations that boosted populists in elections last year with more EU integration, or less?\n\nEconomies are growing again, the flow of refugees has abated, yet a nationalist undercurrent still threatens to submerge the Franco-German vision for the European project.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has taken the lead in pressing to recapture the political initiative and strengthen the EU so it can start solving the problems that have prompted voters to turn to extremists. Key areas he has identified for deepened integration include intelligence sharing and defense, control of the bloc\u2019s outer borders, and a budget for the euro area.\n\nGermany may be getting on board. A preliminary coalition deal reached between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Party and the center-left Social Democrats puts \u201cA New Start for Europe\u201d at the top of its list of priorities.\n\nLast week, Mario Centeno, the new group head for the euro region\u2019s finance ministers, said that the coming months offer a \u201cunique window of opportunity\u201d to strengthen the common currency. He called for agreement by the EU\u2019s June summit to unify banking and capital markets regulation, and to increase fiscal burden sharing.\n\nNational electoral commissions\n\nBut persuading the EU\u2019s 28 nations to agree on game-changing projects is likely to be tough, even with the perennially awkward British heading for the exit door.\n\nEuroskeptic nationalist politicians now run Hungary and Poland. In March, Italy is expected to hold elections that could produce a less pro-European government in Rome. Meanwhile, the far-right Freedom Party of Austria recently joined a coalition government in Vienna. Its party members or affiliates head the foreign, interior and defense ministries.\n\nLast week alone, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung he was \u201cmuch more skeptical\u201d about creating a common budget for the euro area, while Interior Minister Herbert Kickl said infrastructure was needed to \u201cconcentrate\u201d asylum seekers. In an interview published on Friday, he also announced the creation of a \u201cstandby force\u201d ready to man check points on Austria's frontiers within hours of getting the order.\n\nJust how awkward the divisions can be was on display at the last EU summit, in December. A two-hour debate on immigration went so badly that EU President Donald Tusk said it was proving \u201chard to even find common language.\u201d He too gave leaders until June to come to an agreement.\n\nEven the Netherlands\u2019 center-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte has warned that Europe\u2019s project of \u201cever closer union\u201d is a threat, rather than a solution for liberal democracy.\n\n\u201cNo more institutions or even further integration,\u201d Rutte told the European Parliament\u2019s grouping of liberal parties in December. \u201cLook and you will see that the people of Europe are screaming to us through the ballot boxes.

Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nIn Brennero, the village on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass, Pan and others from the German-speaking South Tyrol region, are disturbed by the prospect of an EU that becomes fractured by a return of 20th century nationalism or stops integrating further.\n\nImmigration is at the heart of it. As more than 1 million refugees from Syria, North Africa and elsewhere landed by sea in Greece and Italy in 2015 and 2016, many made their way north to Germany through the Brenner Pass. Austria\u2019s defense minister at one point said he had readied tanks and troops to block the pass if need be.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the economic hit. Last year, about 2.2 million trucks barreled through the mountain crossing. Steady streams of freight and passenger trains run on tracks either side of the highway, carrying goods and people north and south.\n\nBertelsmann Stiftung, January 2018 EUpinions report.\n\nPan\u2019s own Italian company is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of strudel, baking 35 kilometers (22 miles) of the tubular German pastry every day. Most of his consumers aren\u2019t in Italy, but to the north.\n\n\u201cLook at German cars. A year\u2019s production uses 4 billion euros worth of components from Italian manufacturers,\u201d he said, describing the Brenner Pass as part of a Europe-wide assembly line. \u201cMacron\u2019s plan is the way we have to go.\u201d\n\nOf course, the European economy managed healthy growth for decades before the visa-free Schengen area began in 1995, despite internal border checks. But going back would be harder.\n\nIf border guards were put to work under the canopy over the Brenner Pass, \u201cwe\u2019d have 15 to 20 kilometer tailbacks,\u201d said Peter Mock, commissar of the highway police based in Sterzing, a small medieval town 11 miles into the Italian part of Tyrol. The number of trucks crossing the pass has increased by at least eight or nine times since 1995, he said.\n\nFritz Karl Messner Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nThere\u2019s a political worry, too. South Tyrol is a land of schnitzel and beer, more than pasta and wine. It was part of Austria until 1919, when Italy annexed it. Only the negotiation of substantial autonomy from Rome and an increasingly lax border with Austria enabled nationalist passions to subside.\n\nThe flow of refugees coming to Europe has fallen dramatically since last year. Still, soldiers wearing the distinctive raven-feathered caps of Italy\u2019s Alpini brigades patrol the short streets around the Brenner Pass outlet mall. It\u2019s the same regiment that accompanied Mussolini to his meeting with Hitler, in 1940.\n\nFritz Karl Messner, the mayor of Sterzing -- Vipiteno in Italian -- said that for now locals in the little snow-covered ski resort are coping fine with the handful of asylum seekers who have settled here to work. On a recent visit, two African migrants were handing out fliers at either end of the town\u2019s medieval high street.\n\nSpeaking at his offices in the regional capital Bolzano -- Bozen in German -- Governor Arno Kompatscher described the two parts of today\u2019s Tyrol, Austrian and Italian, as a model for the kind of integration the EU needs more of.\n\nSupport for rejoining Austria is marginal, but hardened borders and resurgent nationalism could change that, he said: \u201cThis is a little Europe within Europe.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by John Follain, and Jonathan Tirone", "title": "Now Comes the Fight Over Europe\u2019s Future", "sourceId": "bloomberg", "sourceName": "Bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-21/now-comes-the-fight-over-europe-s-future", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T05:01:09Z"}, {"textData": "Older woman smiling and walking with a nurse who is also smiling.

No one can even agree on when an act of aggression in cyberspace amounts to an act of war. The Pentagon, in its first nuclear strategy review since President Trump took office, is even proposing to use the threat of unleashing nuclear weapons against a country or group that delivered a devastating cyberattack against the critical infrastructure of the United States or its allies. But that doesn\u2019t help with the problem of everyday attacks.\n\nThe most talented state sponsors of attacks \u2014 mostly Russia, China, Iran and North Korea \u2014 have carefully calibrated their operations in cyberspace to achieve their strategic aims while avoiding a real shooting war. So far they have succeeded. While there have been indictments of Iranian and Chinese hackers in major strikes on the United States, they have never seen the inside of an American courtroom.\n\nNorth Korea has been a case study in how a nation learns to make use of its cyberweapons for disruption, revenge or profit, without fear of serious retaliation. It has learned how to station hackers around the world \u2014 in China, Malaysia, Thailand and elsewhere \u2014 and has gotten away with bolder and bolder attacks, from Wannacry to its raid on Bangladesh\u2019s central bank, which nearly resulted in the theft of a billion dollars. (The transfers were halted after $81 million had passed through the Swift system, the international clearinghouse for transactions, after someone at the New York Fed discovered a spelling error \u2014 the word \u201cfandation\u201d for \u201cfoundation\u201d \u2014 and stopped the heist. )\n\nAs James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies put it recently, \u201cNorth Korea is both cautious and cunning in its use of force, including cyberattack.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe North has been successful only against poorly protected targets, of which there are many, suggesting that there is a relatively low ceiling for its cyberattack capabilities.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the explosion of state-sponsored, sophisticated cyberattacks over the past seven or eight years has been fueled, in large part, by the expansion of poorly protected targets. Yes, banks and major utilities have, for the large part, tightened their defenses, and tens of billions of dollars have been made by companies promising all kinds of cyber protections, from the most basic programs loaded on your laptop to sophisticated systems designed to anticipate future action, or watch for variations in the normal behavior of users.\n\nBut none of that has prevented cyberspace from becoming what President Barack Obama termed the \u201cWild, Wild West,\u201d a territory of anarchy, where adversaries take free shots at one another. In the past five years, these attacks have become the cheapest way for nations to undercut one another in the name of bigger strategic goals.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the world has been unable to decide what constitutes fair game, and what should be off limits. For years officials talked about their fear of a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d a devastating strike against the power grid that would turn out the lights from Boston to Washington, or London to Rome. That has not happened, save for limited strikes in Ukraine, widely attributed to Russian hackers, that seemed intended to send a message that they could attack critical infrastructure at any time. Countries have sensed what would happen if they went too far.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, cyberattacks have taken a far more subtle turn. The Russian-led attacks on the 2016 American election \u2014 and similar efforts in France and Germany last year \u2014 are prime examples. While United Nations experts had been struggling to come up with \u201cnorms of behavior\u201d in cyberspace, a consensus about what was off-limits \u2014 like attacks on power grids or safety systems, for example \u2014 few were thinking about the use of the technology to influence elections.\n\nIn fact, the election systems in the United States \u2014 the foundation of American democracy \u2014 were never on the list of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d until Mr. Obama\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, added them in the last days of the administration. By then it was too late.\n\nInfrastructure is only part of the problem. The evidence that has poured out of the United States after more than a year of congressional investigations has left no doubt that Russian hackers \u2014 working largely on behalf of two of Moscow\u2019s spy services, the SVR and the GRU \u2014 did far more than use cyber tools to break into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of key players in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe sophisticated use of \u201cbots\u201d to target key demographic groups with Twitter messages, Facebook ads and just ordinary-looking social media exchanges made it clear that we have entered a new world, in which states marry some of the oldest propaganda techniques with the newest ways to disseminate a divisive message.\n\nYet thinking about how to regulate that kind of activity is tying the West in knots. President Emmanuel Macron in France is proposing that government authorities be able to take down \u201cfake news\u201d during elections, declaring in his New Year\u2019s speech that \u201cif we want to protect liberal democracies, we must be strong and have clear rules.\u201d\n\nYet those rules clearly could not survive in the United States, where First Amendment protections would prohibit the government from stepping in and declaring what is fake and what is not.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s own declarations about what constitutes \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 including articles about the Russian election activity \u2014 underscore the dangers of putting that power into government hands.\n\nThere are other complications. After the election hacks in the United States, many called for \u201creal identities\u201d on the internet, so the world would know exactly who is tweeting or posting. Sensible as it may sound, it would also be a boon to the Russians, the Chinese and any authoritarian government looking to crack down on dissent. In short, the best way to solve the problem of election meddling and anonymous attacks would be a dictator\u2019s dream.\n\nThere have been a few successes in setting norms of behavior, particularly when it comes to banning child pornography or cracking down on intellectual property theft. But those are the easiest issues on which to agree.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United States, for example, would never support rules that banned espionage. And what about rules prohibiting the placement of \u201cimplants\u201d in foreign computer networks, so that in the future they could monitor activity or plant malware to bring a network down?\n\nAmerican and European officials raise the alarm whenever they find such implants in their electrical grids.

Buzz60\n\nThe official emblem of the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Winter Games is seen in downtown Seoul, South Korea, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2018. When athletes of the rival Koreas walked together behind a single flag for the first time since their 1945 division at the start of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, it was a highly emotional event that came on the wave of reconciliation mood following their leaders\u2019 first-ever summit talks. Eighteen years later, now, the Koreas are pushing to produce a similar drama during the upcoming Pyeongchang Olympics. But they haven\u2019t generated as much enthusiastic supports as they had both at home and abroad. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSouth Korea normally encourages North Koreans to defect, but not at next month's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, where North Korea will send an historic delegation.\n\nThe reason: Both countries want to avoid a confrontation at such a sensitive time with the whole world watching.\n\n\u201cThat would be a diplomatic incident that would work in no one\u2019s favor,\u201d said Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.\n\nBoth sides want the Olympics to go smoothly. The two countries will march in the opening ceremony behind the same flag, and the women\u2019s ice hockey team will be the first with players from both countries. North Korea also will send a 230-member cheering squad and a 30-member taekwondo demonstration team.\n\nMore: IOC says North Korea to have 22 athletes in 5 Olympic sports\n\nIn addition, a 140-member orchestra from the North will be part of the delegation and is expected to perform in the South Korean capital of Seoul, 80 miles west of the Olympic site, and Gangneung, a city hosting some of the events.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said Saturday that North Korea will send 22 athletes to 5 Olympic sports this year.\n\nA defection would be a major embarrassment for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and a major blow to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has made peace overtures to the North a central policy.\n\nMoon has urged North Korea to participate.\n\n(Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNeither side has much to worry about because the danger of anyone defecting from the delegation is low, Town said. \u201cThe people who are chosen to go are very loyal to the regime. There will be lots of security.\u201d\n\nThe North\u2019s participation came as a result of a series of historic meetings in a conference room in Panmunjom, a village that straddles the Demilitarized Zone separating the two countries, which have maintained an uneasy truce since the end of a war in 1953.\n\nThe talks led to an agreement by North Korea to send a sizable contingent to the Games.\n\nThe discussions have not resulted in any major diplomatic breakthroughs and are not designed to reach an agreement on North Korea\u2019s controversial nuclear and ballistic missile development, which has led to bellicose exchanges between Kim and President Trump.\n\nMore: North and South Korea agree to form first unified Olympic team\n\nMore: Why the overwhelming majority of North Korean defectors are women\n\nBut Moon sees the Games as an opportunity to lessen tensions, which could lead to broader agreements, and has staked much of his political reputation on hopes the North\u2019s participation will go off without a hitch.\n\nThe North\u2019s delegation will be carefully vetted and consist of regime loyalists, analysts say. Their movements will be highly scripted and they will always be together, providing no opportunities to slip away.\n\n\u201cThese are people they trust,\u201d said Robert Wampler, an analyst at the National Security Archive.\n\nEven so, the North will add security officials to the delegation whose job it will be to monitor the athletes, who will be aware that their families in North Korea will be at risk if they attempt to flee.\n\nDefections are frequent and have been the source of tensions between the two countries. More than 30,000 North Koreans have made it to South Korea since the end of the Korean War.\n\nFour North Korea soldiers dashed across the border to the South last year, in some cases under fire from North Korean soldiers attempting to stop them.\n\nThe bulk of the defections are people fleeing desperate economic circumstances. It is rarer to have privileged members of the regime flee, though there have been a handful of high-level defections.\n\nHistorically, South Korea has encouraged defections and used them as a propaganda leverage against the much poorer and isolated North. South Korea last year quadrupled the reward it pays defectors who escape with valuable intelligence from $217,000 to $860,000.\n\nNo members of North Korean sports teams have ever defected while traveling abroad. \u201cI seriously doubt there is really any risk of defection,\u201d Wampler said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FZLsdP", "title": "North and South Korea agree: neither wants defections during Olympic Games", "sourceId": "usa-today", "sourceName": "USA Today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/21/north-korea-south-korea-winter-olympics-defections/1047507001/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T11:12:07Z"}, {"textData": "Photo\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 A fire at an industrial building on the outskirts of New Delhi broke out as workers were stuffing gunpowder into firecrackers, trapping many of them on the factory\u2019s upper floors as it spread, and leaving at least 17 dead.\n\nThe laborers were paid only a few dollars a day to work in harsh conditions, and at least 10 of those who died on Saturday were women, two of whom were reportedly found tightly embracing each other.\n\nFrequent fires are a tragic reality in India\u2019s urban areas: A blaze at two upscale restaurants in Mumbai killed 14 people last month, and factories in the New Delhi area, including ones manufacturing shoes and plastics, catch fire with some regularity.\n\nAn official with the Delhi Fire Service said the building that went up in flames over the weekend in Bawana, an industrial area outside New Delhi, had no clear fire-safety arrangements, and the Indian news media reported that the businessman who had rented the factory had been taken into custody.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI could smell it first,\u201d Roop Singh, 24, a survivors who jumped off the building\u2019s terrace, told the Sunday Express in India. \u201cBefore I knew it, I was trapped.

Credit Agnes Dherbeys for The New York Times\n\nThe World Economic Forum at Davos has always had a woman problem. The reality is that masters, not mistresses, still run most of the universe. Men lead most of the world\u2019s biggest companies and hold most political leadership positions. And that determines who gets to go to the four-day power confab in the Swiss Alps every year, organizers say.\n\nCriticism, hand-wringing, incentives and quotas over the years have done little to bolster female participation. \u201cPathetic\u201d is how Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, described the place of women at Davos in 2012 when female delegates counted for 17 percent. She suggested setting a quota of 30 percent. (In 2017, women\u2019s participation reached a record high \u2014 slightly more than 20 percent.)\n\nIn an effort to catapult women onto center stage this year, the forum has chosen an all-female lineup of leaders for the first time in its 47-year history. The seven chairwomen include the French director of the International Monetary Fund, the American chief executive of IBM, the prime minister of Norway, the Australian head of the world\u2019s largest trade union, the Italian physicist-director of the international organization studying the structure of the universe, the Indian chairwoman of a microfinance bank that is run by and lends to rural women, and the French chief executive of Engie, one of Europe\u2019s biggest power companies.\n\nIsabelle Kocher, the 51-year-old head of Engie, stands out in the corporate world. An engineer and physicist by training, she is currently the only woman running a CAC 40 company, the exclusive club of the top corporations on the French stock exchange. Fortune ranked her third on its 2017 list of the most powerful women in business outside the United States.\n\nIn an hourlong interview in French in her top-floor office overlooking Paris, Ms. Kocher called it an honor to be chosen as a chairwoman at Davos, describing her fellow leaders as \u201cambassadors of civil society, business and politics.\u201d\n\nShe does not see herself as a modern Joan of Arc shattering corporate glass ceilings. And she denies that she ever had to struggle because of her gender.\n\n\u201cI am often asked this question, and it is not easy, I find,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cPersonally \u2014 so far \u2014 I have never felt that being a woman was a disadvantage or a handicap for me. It\u2019s more that there are still very few women in industrial leadership positions. So people are not used to seeing a woman like me in such a visible position, and that attracts a level of attention, even curiosity, that my male colleagues do not enjoy.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she had ever been the victim of sexism in her career, she laughed it off, saying: \u201cNot in any way that was ever said or done to my face. Or it may be that I decided not to pay attention.\u201d\n\nSexism in the male-dominated energy sector is often subtle. \u201cI realize that every time we discuss a job placement, and look at a list of both male and female candidates,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s a question that comes up pretty much all the time for the woman: \u2018Will she know how to assert herself?\u2019 It\u2019s not meant to be malicious. It\u2019s more, \u2018Will she manage to take leadership of the team you want to entrust to her?\u2019\u201d\n\nSince Ms. Kocher assumed the top job at Engie in May 2016, she has fought hard to restructure the company in the face of climate change. She has focused on selling off assets in conventional power, especially coal, and investing in renewable energy, including wind and solar. She has begun an ambitious investment scheme in digital and other new technologies. She has moved women up into senior management, including the top leadership positions in operational entities, renewable energy, gas storage and China operations.\n\nShe has infused the organization with the same military discipline she brings to her private life.\n\nA divorced mother of five (ages 11 to 25), she rises every day at 5 a.m. She works until she has breakfast as 7:30 with the two children who still live with her in the western Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Then she is driven by chauffeur in a Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell car to Engie\u2019s headquarters in La D\u00e9fense, the business district just west of the city. She switches her cellphone to silent mode when she is off duty with her family, with orders to be disturbed only in an emergency.\n\nAt Engie, she eliminated the practice common in the French corporate world of hourslong meetings with detail-filled presentations that often do not result in decision-making.\n\n\u201cIn France, we have a mania for meetings that start very early and finish very late,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wastes time and creates rigidity in schedules. Everyone knows I hate long meetings.\u201d\n\nShe seldom schedules a meeting past 6 p.m. and has introduced a system of flexible time to accommodate the personal lives of employees.\n\n\u201cFlexibility in the workday is important for me. We are very lucky to live at a time where we can say to our bosses, to our colleagues, \u2018I have my children.\u2019 It\u2019s respected more than it was during our parents\u2019 generation. Back then, if a woman said, \u2018I have to leave because \u2026,\u2019 she had a problem. She was finished. Now there are many fathers who also feel free to say: \u2018I have to leave. I have a life. I have a family. I have a commitment. I belong to such-and-such an association. I\u2019m on a sports team.\u2019\u201d\n\nOver time, she has come to see herself, however reluctantly, as a role model for other women.\n\n\u201cI have received so many letters, messages, emails, testimonies of women whom I meet in international conferences, wherever it may be, who tell me, \u2018It\u2019s great that you have balanced life and work so successfully.\u2019 I now think I have underestimated that, the \u2018role model\u2019 aspect of my life, I must say.\u201d\n\nAsked what she tells these women, she replied: \u201cWomen too often say to themselves: \u2018It\u2019s too difficult. I\u2019m not going to get there.\u2019 I tell them: \u2018Listen, do not question your abilities. Dare to do what you want to do and realize that you can do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Kocher may be about to suffer the first major setback of her professional life. When she succeeded G\u00e9rard Mestrallet as chief executive of Engie, he was allowed to keep his position as chairman of the board for two more years, until May 2018. It was widely predicted that Ms. Kocher would take on that role as well when he stepped down.\n\nNow the French press is reporting that Ms. Kocher may not be given the chairman\u2019s slot. According to Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9, an investigative weekly, the French state, the largest shareholder in Engie with about a 25 percent stake, already has decided that the post will go to someone else.\n\nEngie officials say that no decision has been made. Ms. Kocher declined to comment. The announcement is not likely to come before her participation at Davos. Will it be a man? Will it be a second woman, which could give the impression that it takes two women to do the job that one man used to have? Or will Ms. Kocher prevail?\n\nFollowing is a selection of questions from the interview. The conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nWhat is the message you will bring to Davos?\n\nWe are coming to the end of a cycle. Look at what is happening in the energy sector. With the intolerable levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere, society has realized that it is up against a limit with the energy model as it has been until now. There is a rift between economic development and the planet.\n\nCan governments or a single government sabotage the energy transition?\n\nWe often say that the new energy technologies are \u201c3D\u201d: They are decarbonized; they are decentralized; they are digitalized. Governments play an important role because they define regulations and they create conditions for the energy transition. But, ultimately, there are so many different actors who decide, so I think that no one, not even the president of a country, can stop something that is extraordinarily powerful.\n\nHow serious is air pollution in the world\u2019s largest cities?\n\nHonestly, I have trouble sending people to work in Beijing. But I don\u2019t want to single out Beijing \u2014 there are also other big cities that are difficult, and Beijing has taken exemplary measures to help fix the problem. It is not about the CO 2 , it\u2019s the particles that cars emit, that coal power plants emit. People don\u2019t want to go anymore. You try to put a team together and it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s because of the air quality; it\u2019s a real daily disruption, a real medical issue for children.\n\nWhat is your strategy for Engie and the impact it can have on societal fractures and inequalities?\n\nI put Engie on a strategy to create values in the classic sense of the term, but in a way that has a positive impact on these societal fractures and inequalities.\n\nThe idea is to create conditions so that everyone will be interested in doing the same. We have to create the right conditions. We have to redefine the rules of the game, that\u2019s it.\n\nB\u00e9reng\u00e8re Sim contributed reporting. B\u00e9reng\u00e8re Sim contributed reporting.

Pictures via AP)\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 A very British bear has found itself stuck in the middle of a Russian battle between public entertainment and limiting foreign influence.\n\nThe day before the animated family film \u201cPaddington 2\u201d was scheduled to debut in cinemas, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Culture postponed the release from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, sparking backlash from the country\u2019s Association of Cinema Owners. In a Facebook statement on Wednesday, the organization called the decision to delay \u201cPaddington 2\u201d a \u201cgross interference\u201d by the government, and the Ministry of Culture ultimately relented with the film opening in theaters Saturday.\n\nBut the incident illustrated Russia\u2019s ongoing initiative to prop up its own film industry, one where nine of 10 films are government-funded and often cast Russia in a positive light. The movie theater is just one domain where the modern Russian system walks a fine line of sheltering citizens from Western ideals that may not agree with President Vladimir Putin\u2019s view of the world and Russia's role in it.\n\nA law allows the Ministry of Culture to bump foreign films, such as \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d if their release dates coincide with that of a locally produced film. The rule was enacted two years ago. At the time, culture minister Vladimir Medinsky seemed to make a veiled threat regarding the content of Russian cinema.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t fight for every [Russian] film,\u201d he said then. \u201cWe will set financial, political or ideological priorities.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Andrei Zvyagintsev\u2019s \u201cLeviathan,\u201d a movie about Russia produced by Russians, had its release date postponed by the Ministry of Culture even as it was a hit at international film festivals and won a Golden Globe for best foreign-language film. The bleak tale of a man\u2019s battle with a corrupt local bureaucrat was criticized as anti-Russian and undermining Putin. In response, Russia outlawed movies \u201cdefiling the national culture, posing a threat to national unity and undermining the foundations of the constitutional order.\u201d The Ministry of Culture ultimately reversed its course on that legislation, and public curiosity led to the film\u2019s wide release in Russia.\n\nMedinsky said at the time that the characters, shown taking swigs of vodka, \u201care not Russians,\u201d and that films \u201cfilled with a sense of despair and hopelessness over our existence, should not be financed with taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d Russia banned swearing in arts and media in 2014, which meant that a sanitized version of the film ran in theaters.\n\n\u201cLet all the flowers grow, but we will only water the ones we like,\u201d Zvyagintsev quipped to the Guardian, referencing a quote from Medinsky himself.\n\nThe release of \u201cPaddington 2\u201d was not postponed because of its content, but because of what appeared to be an attempt to eliminate some box office competition for the homegrown \u201cScythian,\u201d a historical drama also scheduled to debut on Jan. 18, and \u201cGoing Vertical,\u201d a patriotic Soviet sports flick about the U.S.S.R.\u2019s Olympic basketball triumph over the U.S. team in 1972. Amid heightened tensions between the United States and Russia, \u201cGoing Vertical\u201d is now Russia\u2019s highest-grossing film ever.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything in the interests of the industry, Russian cinema, but not in the interests of Hollywood,\u201d said Medinsky, according to Interfax.\n\nIn its statement, the Russian Association of Cinema Owners said this is not the first time the government has intervened in a movie\u2019s release date, but it found the last-minute nature of the decision especially outrageous, citing economic damage to the theaters and distributors, who had advertised a Jan. 18 date for \u201cPaddington 2.\u201d Tickets that were bought in advance had to be refunded to spectators.\n\n\u201cYou, with your own initiatives, have turned the standard state service for issuing a rental certificate into an instrument of censorship,\u201d the Association of Cinema Owners\u2019 statement said.\n\nSeveral Russian producers, directors and actors penned an open letter arguing that the government support has led to a 120 percent increase in box office revenue for local films since 2011. The practice of granting Russian movies the best release dates while foreign films are occasionally \u201cmoved\u201d to a different date is one manifestation of that backing.\n\nJust three years ago, Medinsky considered introducing a cap on the number of movies imported to the country each year, according to the Guardian. Then last year, he proposed to lawmakers that one way to boost the Russian film industry would be to make tickets for foreign movies more expensive than local ones, as the state budget for cinema is less than half of what Hollywood spends on a single blockbuster.\n\nIn 2016, just two Russian films, \u201cThe Flight Crew\u201d and \u201cViking,\u201d cracked the country\u2019s top 25 bestsellers, a 17.8 percent share of the $727 million market. In 2017, four films finished in the top 25, not including \u201cGoing Vertical,\u201d which is still in theaters and succeeding.\n\n\u201cViking\u201d came under some scrutiny for how it distinguished between the dirty and violent pagans and the civilized Christians, another ode to the influential Russian Orthodox Church and the government\u2019s agenda. Putin and Medinsky were reportedly among the first viewers, both apparently fans.", "title": "Russian film watchdogs had a problem with \u2018Paddington 2.\u2019 It was too popular.", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/21/russian-film-watchdogs-had-a-problem-with-paddington-2-it-was-too-popular/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T11:00:09Z"}, {"textData": "A Medicine Man cannabis dispensary worker holds a marijuana flower with chopsticks, the typical way unpackaged marijuana is fished from these glass jars before being weighed and sold.

It\u2019s no surprise those businesses want to protect what they\u2019ve built, experts say.\n\n\u201cThese are legitimate, taxpaying businesses that want and deserve to be heard, and lawmakers at every level of government have become more comfortable with accepting their contributions,\u201d said Mason Tvert, a cannabis activist who helped lead Colorado\u2019s legalization effort in 2012.\n\nMore: Justice Department cracks down on legal marijuana with rollback of Obama policy\n\nMore: Uncertainty roils American marijuana industry over feared federal crackdown\n\nMore: Legal marijuana arriving in California after decades of underground dealing\n\nPoliticians are increasingly willing to accept those contributions from an industry that remains illegal at the federal level and now faces even more scrutiny after Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this month rolled back Obama administrationpolicies not to interfere with state laws allowing people to use recreational marijuana.\n\nA growing room filled with maturing marijuana plants inside the Medicine Man cannabis dispensary in Denver. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY)\n\nEight states, along with the District of Columbia, permit adults to possess small amounts of marijuana, and Vermont's governor was expected to make pot legal in the Green Mountain state this weekend.\n\nMoney is also flowing at the state level, where legislators and regulators decide on details about packaging, testing and even who can get business licenses. Legalization ballot initiatives across the country have also been backed by millions of dollars, particularly in California.\n\nCannabis lobbying groups, including the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) and National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), have long lobbied lawmakers, but now marijuana business owners themselves are contributing \u2014 and letting everyone know it.\n\nJohn Lord, the CEO of Colorado-based LivWell Enlightened Health, whose company employs more than 600 people, has donated nearly $23,000 to federal lawmakers in the past four years, and another $10,000 to Colorado politicians and issue committees. Increasingly he\u2019s been giving to Republicans at the federal level.\n\n\"It would be rather imprudent if I didn\u2019t,\u201d Lord said.\n\nLord's donations make him one of the biggest individual donors in cannabis campaign contributions nationally, at least among those who admit where the money comes from. While campaign donors are supposed to disclose their employer, many black-market marijuana growers simply say they're self-employed or a consultant, obscuring the source of the money.\n\nDemocrats have typically been the largest recipients of marijuana campaign money in the past, but Republicans are now taking the lead in accepting those donations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzed contributions at the request of USA TODAY. Experts say the recent shift is largely attributable to the belief by marijuana businesses that Republicans who support states' rights are their best allies today.\n\nPreston Mekelburg, 22, weighs and packages marijuana at the Medicine Man cannabis dispensary in Denver. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY)\n\nBecause marijuana contributions make up such a small percentage of campaign donations and lobbying spending, it's hard to track exactly how much money is flowing to candidates.\n\nIndustry groups with political action committees are the biggest donors, among them the MPP, NORML and the National Cannabis Industry Association, which combined have donated about $327,000 to candidates over the past three Congressional election cycles, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By comparison, the National Beer Wholesalers Association donated about $1.5 million to candidates in the past year alone.\n\nWhile the marijuana contributions represent a proverbial drop in the bucket compared to traditional businesses like brewers, grocers, manufacturers or liquor stores, the increasing flow from cannabis entrepreneurs suggests the industry won\u2019t willingly let the federal government slow this fast-growing juggernaut.\n\nRepublican California Congressman Dana Rohrabacher recently became a favored lawmaker of cannabis contributors for his strong support of the industry: He's the author of legislation banning the Justice Department from targeting legal medical marijuana businesses. Rohrabacher said he\u2019s noticing more and more marijuana money and lobbying on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot to learn. But they\u2019re learning it because they\u2019re here now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe voters of those states have granted them the title of legitimate businessmen.\u201d\n\nThe rapidly growing marijuana industry is finding that politicians are increasingly willing to accept their campaign contributions, said Eli Scislowicz, the operations director of the NuLeaf cannabis dispensary in Lake Tahoe\u2019s Incline Village, Nev.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, we might have gotten a few weird looks if we offered them money, but not anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nGlass jars of marijuana offered for sale at the Medicine Man cannabis dispensary in Denver.

There\u2019s such a deep history in my community around cannabis use and the effects of cannabis prohibition. My own family has been affected, significantly, by the war on drugs. That was another huge motivation for me to get into the industry and make an impact.\u201d\nReese Benton,\u00a0entrepreneur, Posh Green Collective\n\n  A post shared by Reese (@thestylistreeseb) on Dec 29, 2017 at 1:44pm PST \n\u201cI\u2019m the only African American woman that has any kind of cannabis business in San Francisco.\u00a0I do on-demand hair. I thought: I work on demand, I work with all these tech people, I go to people\u2019s houses. Let me open up a delivery service. So I just read and read and trained myself, and then I opened it up last year. For me to be able to be here after seeing all of this craziness and dysfunction is a dream. And to be able to go to the next level in this business, I never knew how I was going to make it in this world or how I was going to be able to capitalize on anything to be stable, and finally, because of this, I\u2019ll be able to have money. I\u2019ll be stable. And I\u2019ll also have a successful business \u2015 everything I always wanted and that I work hard for every day.\u00a0\nAshley Brooke and Tahirah Hairston, founders of The High Ends\n  A post shared by @thehighendsnyc on Apr 20, 2017 at 9:58am PDT\n\n\u201cThe High Ends is a community (and soon to be content platform) for women who smoke and want to explore their relationship with the plant amongst like-minded people. We\u2019re working to disrupt image of what a woman who smokes weed looks like. Too often we were flooded with images that were either oversexualized or super carefree and bohemian\u2014and mostly white. It wasn\u2019t a realistic picture of what our world looked like, and it was important for us to open up the scope and create a space that showcases diverse women across all races, cultures, and professions. As black women in the industry, it has become even more important to carve out that space for women of color as cannabis becomes legalized and the people reaping the benefits remain predominantly white. Black and brown women are often stigmatized and still unfairly prosecuted for our relationship with weed, The High Ends wants to help combat that and create more opportunities for our stories to be told. Our hope is that by amplifying the voices and lifestyles of the many faces of women who smoke for reasons that range from chronic pain to distress to creative brainstorming, we\u2019ll create a new image of what it means to be a woman who smokes.\u201d\nNicole Gonzalez, marketing assistant, founder of @stigmafit\n  A post shared by Nicole Gonzales (@cannabisweetie) on Sep 8, 2017 at 11:34am PDT \n\u201cI want to give people inspiration to get outside and explore the world around them.

To be a \u201cwomen in weed\u201d to me means a strong female figure making moves and making a change in the cannabis industry. A woman who can have a voice for the community. Women are taking over this industry and #breakinggrassceilings!\u2033\nMaya Elizabeth, co-founder, Whoopi & Maya\n\n  A post shared by Whoopi & Maya (@whoopiandmaya) on Nov 8, 2017 at 11:08am PST \n\u201cI was always in love with cannabis. Almost 15 years ago, I started working at a dispensary. I just could never see myself going back to a regular job. I go to help people. I got to hold a space for people that was really missing. A lot of these people were suffering, slipping through the cracks and just couldn\u2019t afford health care.\u00a0I got a cold call that there was a celebrity who wanted to make a menstrual line and I was a good person to talk to, and I said absolutely.\u00a0Whoopi [Goldberg] wanted to guinea pig some people that she knew who had severe menstrual cycles, and I was told if it worked we\u2019d move forward, and if it didn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t. It worked, and it works for a good reason.\u201d\nLeslie Valencia, researcher and founder of Cannabis Equity Org\n\n\u201cWomen of color have played a critical role in ensuring equity in cannabis.\u00a0We know that the LGBT community was one of the main reasons that cannabis was legalized in San Francisco and in California, we know that veterans are also playing a big role in the cannabis industry in advocacy and in using it as a medical treatment for PTSD. We know, of course, people of color, of course, women in general, have ties to it. People with disabilities using this, cancer patients, senior citizens have their own coalition. Immigrants, undocumented folks play an important role.\u00a0In this field, it\u2019s amazing how you can have discussions about all of these topics and interact with all of these people and have conversations that truly address all of these topics. Immigrants, undocumented folks play an important role. By far, of any topic that I\u2019ve studied, it\u2019s had the most intersectionality.\u201d\nKebra Smith-Bolden, registered nurse and president of CannaHealth CT and Cannabis Consultants of CT\n\u201cAs a \u2018woman in weed,\u2019 I have merged my traditional career as a registered nurse with the unconventional cannabis industry. As a cannabis nurse, I focus my energy on researching how and why people consume. I study the effective use of cannabis in conjunction with therapy for inner-city residents suffering from complex traumas. I also have the opportunity to work on \u2018righting the wrongs\u2019 of the prohibition of cannabis and the detrimental effects the criminalization of cannabis has had on communities of color as a result of the war on drugs. By providing education, avenues to entrepreneurship and equal opportunities despite race, class or socioeconomic status, communities of color can initiate the healing process and discontinue the suffering endured due to years of racial, social and economic inequities.\u201d\nLisa Sanchez, cannabis artist, speaker and advocate at Visine Queen\n\n  A post shared by the only VISINEQUEEN \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf4|\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@visinequeen) on Dec 6, 2017 at 12:42pm PST \n\u201cI started visinequeen.com\u00a0in 2008. At the time, it was for images of cannabis plants, art, clothes and whatever pictures I could find of women smoking. My [advocacy] work came about a few years into creating art and realizing that women of color are not represented properly. At the time, inclusion didn\u2019t seem like a priority in the cannabis space. It was important to me to be a part of the inclusion that needed to happen within cannabis art. Today I create cannabis art to promote women of color and empower any woman who uses cannabis medically, recreationally or spiritually. My hope is that the black and Latino community sees cannabis legalization, cultivation and the businesses that come with it as opportunities \u2015 stepping stones that will restore what we have lost, or what we never have had a chance to build.\u201d\nDr. Rachel Knox, Dr. Janice Knox, Dr. Jessica Knox, co-founders, The Canna MDs\n  A post shared by Dr. Rachel M Knox, MD, MBA (@thedocknox) on Oct 15, 2016 at 8:08pm PDT \nAmber Senter, COO of Magnolia Wellness Collective, Leisure Life founder and Supernova Women co-founder\n  A post shared by Supernova Women (@supernovawomen) on Jun 25, 2016 at 10:00am PDT \nVerena von Vetten, founder of Gossamer magazine\n  A post shared by Verena von Pfetten (@vonverena) on Jan 2, 2018 at 10:52am PST \nI\u2019m the co-founder of Gossamer, a lifestyle publication for the modern cannabis consumer, covering culture, travel, design, art, and food through a \u201cgreen\u201d lens.\u00a0One of our goals with Gossamer, particularly as a lifestyle publication, is to change the perception of cannabis and cannabis consumers and, in doing so, help move the conversation around legalization and social justice forward, and perhaps into spaces that have been historically inhospitable to it.\u00a0Legal cannabis is an entirely new industry in this country, which means there\u2019s an incredible opportunity to build it mindfully, such that it is inclusive and diverse across all genders, sexual identities, races, and classes.

Previously known as the Polishuk House, the ship-like structure was first purchased by Yehuda Polishuk, a Ukrainian immigrant who arrived in pre-state Palestine in 1934 and leased its three curving floors to businesses including a shoemaker and a printing press. The Israeli architect Nitza Szmuk, an expert in preserving the historic buildings that comprise Tel Aviv\u2019s Unesco-designated White City, took care to maintain the building\u2019s original curved staircase and to source Italian tiles that would resurrect the original external facade.

(Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters)\n\nThis week, President Trump is scheduled to head to the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The U.S. leader may seem an unlikely guest \u2014 Davos brings together the world's political and economic elite for what is generally viewed as a celebration of globalization.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is known for his populist views on trade and criticism of \u201cthe false song of globalism.\u201d Indeed, Trump is expected to call for more reciprocal trade deals in a speech Friday. The scale of the disagreement between the two viewpoints is outlined in a new paper put out by the WEF's network of trade experts ahead of Trump's arrival; it directly challenges his administration's views on trade.\n\nDescribed as a \u201cStrategic Brief on Misconceptions around Trade Balances,\u201d the paper criticizes the narratives that have emerged in a number of countries that relate how \u201cunfair\u201d trade policies led to \u201clarge trade deficits, particularly in goods trade, which in turn have driven a decline in manufacturing employment over the past two decades.\u201d\n\nThe paper, which was first reported by Reuters, does not mention Trump by name. It does, however, state that these narratives have emerged in \u201cthe United States as well as elsewhere\u201d and that the current U.S. \u201cadministration is seeking to reduce the trade deficit by renegotiating U.S. trade agreements and adopting more protectionist U.S. policies.\u201d\n\nIn all of Trump's foreign policy, his distaste for what he views as \u201cbad trade deals\u201d may be one of the most consistent positions. The president has criticized not only multilateral trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but also bilateral deals with allies, such as the free-trade agreement with South Korea. Trade deficits, such as the sprawling gap that exists in trade with China, are a particular subject of ire for the Trump administration, too.\n\nThe WEF paper describes a number of \u201cmisconceptions\u201d about trade and includes short rebuttals to them, as well as two graphs that look at the link between U.S. trade against employment and GDP growth. Lead authors Robert Lawrence, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and Yeling Tan, a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, specifically address many ideas about trade put forward by Trump and his surrogates.\n\nFor example, the paper states that it is a misconception that bilateral trade between two nations should be balanced. \u201cIf a bilateral free trade agreement allows a country to meet more of its needs by importing at lower costs from a particular partner, it will benefit,\u201d the authors write, \u201ceven if the value of these increased imports exceeds the value of the exports that it sells to that partner.\u201d\n\nThe paper also takes aim at the idea that trade deficits result in job loss. \u201cWhile in theory the relationship between imports, trade deficits, and employment and growth could be positive or negative, in practice in the United States, rapid import growth and larger trade deficits have been associated with faster employment growth,\u201d the authors note.\n\nThese positions will likely be shared by many at Davos. In a recent report compiled by the WEF on the most pressing issues the world faces in the present and may face in the future, the \u201cdeath of trade\u201d was listed as a future shock. \u201cAgainst a backdrop of deepening protectionist sentiment, trade disputes could spread rapidly by triggering adverse impacts and retaliatory moves along global value chains,\u201d the report warns.\n\nWill Trump heed the advice? Though the president is sometimes seen as persuadable on certain issues, he has been stubborn on the risks posed by trade. When Trump appeared at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, last year, he gave a speech that struck a distinctly protectionist tone, despite warnings that China was moving to fill the void in international trade.\n\nIndeed, even as Trump heads to Davos to mingle with the free-trade elites, his team is believed to be in the final stages of planning trade penalties against China for what are viewed as unfair practices.\n\nMore on WorldViews\n\nBreitbart called Davos a collective of \u2018leftist elites\u2019 and \u2018corporate cronies.\u2019 Then Trump said he was going.", "title": "Ahead of Trump\u2019s trip to Davos, its experts argue that he doesn\u2019t understand trade deficits", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/21/ahead-of-trumps-trip-to-davos-its-experts-argue-that-he-doesnt-understand-trade-deficits/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T10:00:07Z"}, {"textData": "Turkish military trucks carrying tanks and other armoured vehicles cross through a border gate into a Turkish-controlled region of the Oncupinar border crossing with Syria, known as Bab al Salameh in Arabic, near the city of Kilis, Turkey, late Saturday, Jan. 20, 2018.

Most of the rooms were occupied, with at least 100 guests of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology staying there for a conference.\n\nThe attack comes amid intensifying violence around the country. In the northern province of Balkh, which has been at the center of a recent political showdown with the central government, at least 18 people were killed in an attack by the Taliban late Saturday, most of them members of the local police force, officials there said.\n\nSarajuddin Abed, the governor of Sholgara district, which includes the site of that assault, said that initial information suggested members of the local police had been poisoned before they were attacked, but that the incident was still under investigation.\n\nIn Kabul, helicopters and drones circled above the hotel for hours while guests hid inside, many cowering under beds or in toilet stalls.

The Serena Hotel, a luxury hotel in Kabul, has been struck three times, including an attack in 2014 that killed nine. In that assault, Taliban gunmen hid small pistols in the soles of their shoes to evade heavy security, then entered the restaurant and killed guests at close range, including a well-known Afghan journalist, his wife and all but one of his children. The events led to an unusual apology for what the Taliban called a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the Park Palace hotel in downtown Kabul was attacked, killing at least 15 people, including one American.\n\nSoon after sunrise on Sunday, there were glimmers of hope in the capital.

In November, a North Korean soldier dashed across Panmunjom through a hail of bullets from fellow Communist troops to defect to the South.\n\nBy sending the performers across Panmunjom less than three months after the soldier\u2019s defection, Mr. Kim wanted to punctuate the dramatic shift in mood between the two Koreas, analysts said.\n\nAlso on Sunday, North Korea agreed to let an advance team of South Korean officials visit ski and tourist resorts on its eastern coast for three days beginning Tuesday, South Korean officials said.

(B.K. Bangash/AP)\n\nISLAMABAD \u2014 The long struggle to eliminate polio from Pakistan has faced many obstacles \u2014 public ignorance about the disease, myths about a Western plot to sterilize Muslims, claims about fake vaccination drives being used to cover up spying. Add to that list: Attacks by anti-government insurgents on teams delivering the polio vaccine, mostly around the lawless northwest tribal areas.\n\nNow, just as the campaign was nearing its total eradication goal \u2014 with only eight new cases of the crippling virus reported in the past year \u2014 an especially coldblooded assault has left a mother and one of her seven children dead, slain on Thursday as they were distributing polio drops in the violence-plagued southwest city of Quetta.\n\nThe mother and her 16-year-old daughter were not accompanied by armed security guards, although they have long been provided for vaccination teams in Pakistan. A police official in Quetta said the local guards had been removed because they were \u201cdrawing attention.\u201d Pakistani commentators noted there is an ongoing debate about whether such guards help or hinder vaccinators\u2019 safety.\n\nThe anti-polio campaign is supported by the World Health Organization, UNICEF and other international agencies, which have assisted in successfully eradicating the virus in most of the world. The slain women were participating in a new drive in which hundreds of mobile vaccination teams are providing polio drops in communities across the country.\n\nThe killings were carried out by unknown drive-by killers, who shot the mother and daughter in the head as they sped past on motorbikes. There was no warning, no explanation, and no claim of responsibility. But the attack resembled previous ones by militant groups such as the Taliban, which have killed more than 100 Pakistani vaccinators and their police guards in the past five years.\n\nOfficials of national anti-polio organizations vowed the latest attack would not deter or slow efforts to end polio in Pakistan, one of the last countries where the virus remains endemic. Another is Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe killings are very, very sad, but they will not have any impact on the eradication campaign, because the federal government and all the international partners are fully committed to eradicate polio from Pakistan. We will not be brought down by this,\u201d said Aziz Memon, chairman of the Pakistan Polio Plus Committee in Karachi.\n\nMemon said the last known attack on vaccinators in Balochistan Province, a vast desert region where Quetta is located, took place more than two years ago, when organized opposition to the anti-polio drive was high and many families were refusing to allow their children to be vaccinated.\n\nSuspicion was aggravated in 2011 by the arrest of a Pakistani doctor who visited homes in a purported vaccination drive in the northwest region. He was later found to have been part of U.S. intelligence effort to locate al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was then killed in a U.S. raid on a Pakistani compound in 2011.\n\nSince then, some prominent Pakistani clerics have publicly endorsed the anti-polio campaign and attacks have become less frequent.\n\n\u201cWe thought the refusal and violent agitation were over,\u201d Memon said. He suggested the Quetta attack could have been more broadly aimed at opposing the government, and he noted that three provincial policemen were also shot dead there the same day. The Pakistani Taliban claimed that attack.\n\nThe slain mother and daughter were identified by police as Sakina, 38, and Rizwana, 16. The mother, whose youngest child is a year old, was paid $150 per month for her work. Memon said her husband is a truck driver and the family lives in an urban shantytown.

Knock it off.\u2019\u201d\n\nSandy said that Betsy, who completed a highly structured treatment program and underwent cognitive behavioral therapy, seemed more motivated than Patrick to quit.\n\nAnd Betsy, who started using drugs at 19, said she suspected that Patrick had a harder time quitting because he had started when he was 14. A Surgeon General\u2019s report in 2016 said that the younger people are when they start taking drugs, the more likely they are to become addicted long-term. \u201cHis brain is still that young,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cAs intelligent as he is, this is his only coping mechanism.\u201d\n\nIt was especially difficult getting clean while her brother was still using, Betsy said, as she cuddled a frisky mutt outside the animal shelter.

Nationally, the state, which has no income or sales tax, ranks at the bottom in availability of treatment programs. The fire departments\u2019 safe stations are one effort to fill that void.\n\nThe researchers also noted that the state has pockets of \u201ceconomic degradation,\u201d especially in rural areas where jobs are few, and that may contribute to the problem.\n\nBeyond that, the researchers say, doctors here have long prescribed \u201csignificantly higher rates\u201d of opioid pain relievers, almost twice the national average.

New Hampshire finally legalized needle exchanges in June, long after many other states had done so, but did not fund them.

The deployment occurred hours after dozens of Turkish jets bombed Syrian Kurdish militia targets in the enclave of Afrin. (Can Erok/DHA-Depo Photos via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nHASSA, Turkey \u2014 Turkish troops and Syrian opposition forces attacked a Kurdish enclave in northern Syria on Sunday in their bid to drive a U.S.-allied Kurdish militia from the region.\n\nTurkish officials said the troops entered Afrin a day after dozens of Turkish jets and artillery units at the border pounded Syrian Kurdish targets. A spokesman for the Kurdish fighters said the attack was repelled.\n\nTurkey considers the Syrian Kurdish militia, known as the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, a terror organization and a security threat because of its affiliation to Kurdish rebels fighting in southeastern Turkey.\n\nThe group controls Afrin, in Syria\u2019s northwestern Aleppo province, as well as a swath of territory to the east along Turkey\u2019s border. The YPG also forms the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main U.S. ally against the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said the Turkish-backed fighters had penetrated 5 kilometers (3 miles) into Afrin as part of the offensive, codenamed Olive Branch.\n\nIn a statement, the Syrian opposition fighters battling alongside the Turkish troops said the combined force seized Shankal, a village on the northwestern edge of Afrin district.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali denied that Turkish troops had entered Afrin, saying Kurdish forces had been repelling attacks since Saturday. Bali said the SDF had sent reinforcements to Afrin.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the Kurdish militia and Turkish forces have clashed on the northern and western edges of Afrin. The Observatory said the Turkey-backed forces have entered Shankal and are clashing with the Kurds.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to expand the offensive to Manbij, a town to the east that Kurdish forces seized from the Islamic State group in a costly battle with the aid of the U.S.-led coalition. The town has since emerged as a model for U.S.-backed Kurdish rule of largely Arab areas.\n\nAn advance on Manbij by NATO member Turkey would pit two close U.S. allies against one another, adding another front to the already complex Syrian civil war.\n\nTurkish troops first crossed into Syria after the Kurds captured Manbij in 2016, in part to prevent them from expanding westward and linking up to Afrin. At least 70 Turkish soldiers have been killed since then, most in battles with the Islamic State group, which has since been driven from nearly all the territory it once held in Syria.\n\nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim told a group of journalists on Sunday that Turkey aims to create a 30-kilometer (20-mile) deep \u201csecure zone\u201d in Afrin, according to Turkish media reports. He told reporters that there were between 8,000 and 10,000 \u201cterrorists\u201d in Afrin.\n\nEarlier Sunday, four rockets fired from Syria hit the Turkish border town of Kilis, prompting Turkish artillery to return fire, Gov. Mehmet Tekinarslan said. The rockets hit two houses and a workplace, and slightly wounded one person.\n\nAssociated Press journalists on the border saw a convoy of trucks, believed to belong to Syrian opposition fighters, carrying pick-up trucks mounted with arms. Artillery shelling could be heard in the distance.\n\nTurkey has prepared around 10,000 Syrian fighters to storm Afrin, according Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group.\n\nA Syrian commander speaking to the AP by phone from northern Syria said there were thousands of fighters positioned in Azaz, at the frontier with the Kurdish enclave, awaiting orders. Another commander said hundreds more were stationed in Atmeh, south of Afrin. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nTurkish leaders were infuriated by an announcement by the U.S. military this week that it was going to create a 30,000-strong border force with the Kurdish fighters to secure northern Syria. Days later, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that the U.S. would maintain a military presence with the Kurds for the foreseeable future.\n\n__\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.

(AP/Michael Wyke)\n\nThe Houston Rockets beat the Golden State Warriors on Saturday night, 116-108, in a game that saw Houston end Golden State\u2019s 14-game road winning streak while improving to 17-0 with Chris Paul, James Harden and Clint Capela in the lineup this season.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Saturday night\u2019s showdown in Houston:\n\n1. Houston\u2019s experiment is working\n\nAs the fourth quarter got underway, Rockets Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni was asked on television what the difference would be in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cHopefully our two future Hall of Famers,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\nIt turned out D\u2019Antoni was right.\n\nPaul had 33 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, Harden had 22 points and eight assists and both controlled the game throughout. Each played 35 minutes, and provided Houston with precisely what was expected of them when Paul was acquired via trade last June: 48 minutes of Hall of Fame point guard play in every game. Even with Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green suspended as a result of the fracas in Los Angeles on Monday night, the Rockets still had more than enough to control this game from start to finish because Paul and Harden were magnificent.\n\n[NBA Podcast: Answering questions about Kemba Walker, Wizards\u2019 struggles and more]\n\n2. Harden\u2019s MVP moment\n\nIf Harden finally wins the NBA\u2019s MVP award this season after finishing as runner-up to Stephen Curry in 2015 and Russell Westbrook last season, the moment everyone will remember came with 1:10 remaining in the fourth quarter. That was when Harden, with the shot clock expiring, buried a three-pointer from the wing \u2013 over Curry, no less \u2013 to give Houston a six-point lead and essentially ice the game.\n\nIt seemed like Harden\u2019s chances of winning MVP \u2013 he was the front-runner through the first two months of the regular season \u2013 took a potentially fatal blow when he suffered a hamstring injury a few weeks ago. But while Harden was able to come back in about two weeks \u2013 matching the most optimistic scenarios for his return \u2013 his chief rival for the award this season, LeBron James, has watched his Cleveland Cavaliers fall into the gutter, losing 10 of their last 14 games (including Saturday\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City in which Cleveland surrendered 148 points).\n\nNow Harden once again looks like the MVP front-runner, and if Houston can stay where it is in the standings for the remainder of the season, it will be this moment \u2013 burying that shot over Curry to beat the Warriors, and to clinch Houston\u2019s 2-1 edge in the season series \u2013 that will become the defining memory of his 2017-18 season.\n\n[The NBA\u2019s All-Star Game starters are out. Here\u2019s who should be the reserves.]\n\n3. Houston has the right mix to threaten Golden State\n\nFrom the moment Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey finalized his roster last summer, Houston clearly had a formidable team, and one that could give everyone in the West fits. But what we\u2019ve seen through this first half of the season is that the Rockets are uniquely suited to give Golden State trouble.\n\nThe combination of Paul and Harden are so adept at drawing fouls \u2013 and hitting free throws \u2013 that they can get Golden State into the penalty early and often, and take advantage when they do. To that point: Houston went 20-for-29 from the foul line Saturday; Golden State 11-for-15. The Rockets also boast a parade of three-point shooters, allowing them to put at least four on the court at any one time, which helped them go 14-for-37 from beyond the arc Saturday. But, most importantly, the Rockets have the length and defensive versatility to credibly challenge the Warriors\u2019 trump card these past few years \u2013 playing Draymond Green at center in small lineups \u2013 in ways that only James and the Cavaliers have previously been able to.\n\nHouston closed this game with Paul, Harden, Capela, Eric Gordon and P.J. Tucker. That lineup \u2013 or an even smaller, even more switchable lineup with Ariza replacing Capela \u2013 gives Houston the opportunity to be explosive offensively and long enough defensively to not be overwhelmed by Golden State\u2019s small-ball attack, which no other team in the league can say. It is noteworthy that in a game in which Golden State went small late, Houston matched them, went toe-to-toe and came out on top.\n\n[Kelly Oubre Jr.\u2019s career night in Detroit was delivered with poise and some added flavor]\n\n4. Golden State\u2019s ceiling remains immense\n\nAll that being said, Golden State didn\u2019t play particularly well and still had every chance to win it with four minutes to go. Golden State had 19 turnovers that resulted in 23 Houston points, including a combined 15 by Curry (six), Green (five) and Kevin Durant (four). The Warriors committed too many fouls, allowing Houston to get into the penalty and exacerbate its free throw advantage. They gave up 12 offensive rebounds, while only collecting four themselves.\n\nMost teams with those kinds of issues against a team as good as Houston on the road would get handled easily. Instead, Golden State appeared it was going to find a way up until the moment Harden buried that shot over Curry.\n\nThat is only further proof that Golden State, at its best, still laps the rest of the field. But what this game also showed is that the Rockets have the ability to make the Warriors uncomfortable \u2013 and take advantage of it.\n\n5. Will Houston\u2019s short bench come back to haunt it?\n\nD\u2019Antoni only played eight players in keeping with his career-long penchant for holding to a short rotation. He would argue that both Ariza and Green would have played had they been available (and Ariza obviously would\u2019ve played a lot), but it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s going to ride his stalwarts hard all season long.\n\nPart of the defense of D\u2019Antoni\u2019s strategy is that Houston had go through a lot of machinations just to put this roster together last summer \u2013 and, in doing so, left itself with a fairly short bench. That\u2019s something Morey knows as well as anyone, and undoubtedly will be trying to remedy between now and the buyout deadline March 1. Houston will be active before the Feb. 8 trade deadline, but with the lack of assets at their disposal, even someone as creative as Morey will face serious challenges. The buyout market, however, could yield someone looking for rotation minutes on a championship contender.\n\nWhy could this matter? Well, anyone who witnessed the end of Houston\u2019s second-round series with San Antonio last year saw Harden fall apart at the end of Game 5 and for all of Game 6. If the Rockets are going to make it to the Western Conference finals and take down the Warriors, they\u2019re going to need to keep him, Paul and the rest of what is a veteran team upright throughout the playoffs.\n\nRead more on the NBA:\n\nHow Lance Stephenson, a brash Brooklyn streetball legend, found a home in humble Hoosier country\n\nNo one is happier to be an NBA all-star than the 76ers\u2019 Joel Embiid\n\nStephen Curry, Kevin Durant join in as Colin Kaepernick nears end of $1 million pledge\n\nJalen Rose tells Paul Pierce he\u2019s \u2018petty\u2019 for opposing Isaiah Thomas tribute", "title": "Five takeaways from the Rockets' streak-halting victory over the reigning champions", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/01/21/five-takeaways-from-the-rockets-streak-halting-victory-over-the-reigning-champions/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T07:21:00Z"}, {"textData": "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d chameleon Kate McKinnon\u00a0pulled off yet another dead-on imitation of a Washington personality, this time conjuring up a barely-contained, gleeful Robert Mueller.\nThe \u201cWeekend Update\u201d sketch featured McKinnon as the long-faced, toothpick-chewing Mueller who\u2019s so excited about getting the goods on the White House crew.

Lebanon is holding its first parliamentary elections in nearly ten years in May. The government and local groups, with help from the United Nations and the European Union, are campaigning to get at least five times more women elected to the parliament, a daunting task in this country that may look like the Middle East\u2019s most liberal. (Bilal Hussein/Associated Press)\n\nBEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon is campaigning to get at least five times more women elected to parliament this spring in its first vote in nearly 10 years, the country\u2019s first women\u2019s affairs minister says.\n\nIt is a daunting task for a Middle Eastern country that may otherwise look like one of the most liberal in the region.\n\nDespite a relatively free press, diverse religious groups and women in prominent positions in the business world and the media, Lebanon ranks surprisingly low when it comes to female representation in politics, and politicians have failed to act on a movement to institute a quota for women in parliament.\n\n\u201cKeeping women from public life is not only a loss for women. It is a loss for the parliament,\u201d Minister of State for Women\u2019s Affairs Jean Oghassabian told The Associated Press. \u201cThe main obstacles are mentality, a philosophy of life, and this needs time,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are only four women in the outgoing parliament elected in 2009, a flimsy 3 percent of its 128 lawmakers. It was a drop from 2005, when six women were elected. Since 2004, there have been one or at most two posts for women in government.\n\nCompared to other countries in the region, Lebanon ranks as one of the lowest in terms of female representation in parliament, with only Oman, Kuwait and Yemen having fewer. Oman and Kuwait have one and two women representatives respectively. War-torn Yemen has none and is currently without a functioning parliament.\n\nEven in ultraconservative Saudi Arabia, the monarch appointed 30 women to the consultative Shura Council, giving them nearly 20 percent of the seats.\n\n\u201cIn politics, there seems to be some kind of invisible barrier for women to really break through,\u201d Christina Lassen, European Union Ambassador to Lebanon, told The Associated Press at a conference held last week to promote women\u2019s representation.\n\nThree months before the vote, the Women\u2019s Affairs Ministry in collaboration with the United Nations and the EU launched a campaign to boost women\u2019s numbers in the elections, with the slogan: \u201cHalf the society, half the parliament.\u201d\n\nBillboards went up in several Beirut districts. Programs on local TV stations about women in politics are airing weekly and local groups say they are training women candidates on public speaking.\n\nOghassabian said last year\u2019s decision to appoint a man to the newly created portfolio was meant to send a message that it is also \u201ca man\u2019s duty\u201d to fight for women\u2019s rights.\n\nHolding parliamentary elections in Lebanon is a feat in itself. Scheduled for May, these are the first elections in the country since 2009. Previous votes were delayed amid instability and haggling over a new election law.\n\nSeats in the Lebanese parliament are allotted according to sects, with each community distributing them according to region and strongholds. In this complex confessional-based political system, adding a women\u2019s quota was too complicated for some to contemplate, said Nora Mourad, a gender researcher with the United Nations Development Program.\n\nLast year, the politicians refused to even discuss a female quota in the new law. Members of the powerful Shiite group, Hezbollah, walked out of the room before the discussion began.\n\n\u201cWe are against a quota. We are against imposing conditions from the outside on our policies and roles and work,\u201d said Rima Fakhry, a politician from the conservative Shiite group. \u201cThe women movement considers that women should reach decision-making positions. For them it is in parliament. We differ with those movements.\u201d\n\nAlthough Fakhry herself is a senior member of the political bureau of Hezbollah, she told the audience at the conference that her group doesn\u2019t see the role of a lawmaker as befitting for a woman in Lebanon. Her group won\u2019t nominate women to run for office.\n\n\u201cFor us, the woman is a woman. She must work to realize the main goals she exists for. These are not different from those of men. But the difference is in the details,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has a home. She is a mother and must bring up generations. This takes a lot of the woman\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nEven though the country\u2019s civil war ended 28 years ago, its politics are still dominated by former warlords and family dynasties, and elections are often settled behind closed doors.\n\nMost women in politics have their posts because they are related to influential male politicians. Of the four women currently in parliament, one is the aunt of the current prime minister, another is the wife of a party leader, and the other two are the daughters of an assassinated media figure and a former minister.\n\nStill, Oghassabian said he expects at least 20 women to make it into parliament, and dozens more to run.\n\nThe new law introduced a complicated proportional representation system that would preserve the sectarian nature of the parliament. But some argue it will offer women and independents a better chance.\n\nLocal groups, along with the U.N. and EU, are encouraging political parties to have a voluntary quota for women on their lists. Women\u2019s groups are contemplating all-women lists as well as a campaign of \u201cno-woman, no-vote\u201d to pressure political parties to include women on their lists.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s conference, representatives from the political parties said internal deliberations are ongoing. One senior member of the Future party said he will recommend 20 percent women\u2019s representation. Another, from the Progressive Socialist Party, said it has commissioned a review of internal literature to ensure women\u2019s issues and requests are reflected.\n\nVictoria El-Khoury Zwein, a potential candidate with a new party called Sabaa, or seven, said she\u2019s skeptical that veteran parties would give women a winning chance. But she said with proportional representation, she\u2019s optimistic she needs fewer votes to make it.\n\n\u201cThere must be 15 percent of the population who want a new political class,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not an easy battle. But we can (do it).\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They accused the U.S. of siding with Israel and said Washington can no longer serve as a mediator.\n\nJerusalem is the emotional centerpiece of the long-running conflict, and Trump\u2019s policy shift set off protests and condemnation across Arab and Muslim countries.\n\nIt posed a dilemma for Abdullah, who is a staunch U.S. ally, but also derives his political legitimacy in large part from the Hashemite dynasty\u2019s role as guardian of a key Muslim site in Jerusalem. Any perceived threat to Muslim claims in the city is seen as a challenge to Jordan, where a large segment of the population is of Palestinian origin.\n\nPence told Jordan\u2019s monarch on Sunday that Trump made it clear in his announcement on Jerusalem \u201cthat we are committed to continue to respect Jordan\u2019s role as the custodian of holy sites, that we take no position on boundaries and final status.\u201d\n\nHe said Jordan would continue to play a central role in any future peace efforts.\n\nThe vice president also praised Jordan\u2019s contribution to a U.S.-led military campaign against Islamic State extremists who in recent months were pushed back from large areas in Iraq and Syria, both neighbors of Jordan.\n\nAbdullah expressed concerns about the regional fallout from the Jerusalem decision.\n\n\u201cToday we have a major challenge to overcome, especially with some of the rising frustrations,\u201d he said. He described the Pence visit as a mission \u201cto rebuild trust and confidence\u201d in getting to a two-state solution, in which a state of Palestine would be established in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967.\n\nAnother cause of concern for Jordan is the Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Jordan vehemently opposes such a move if taken ahead of an Israeli-Palestinian partition deal.\n\nIsrael views Jerusalem as its unified capital.\n\nA longstanding international consensus holds that the city\u2019s final status should be decided through negotiations, which was also U.S. policy going back decades.\n\nPalestinians view Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as a blatantly one-sided move.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not meet with Trump administration officials and called off a meeting with Pence that had been scheduled for mid-December.\n\nIn a new expression of that snub, Abbas overlapped with Pence in Jordan from Saturday evening to midday Sunday, when the Palestinian leader flew to Brussels for a meeting with EU foreign ministers Monday. There, Abbas is expected to urge EU member states to recognize a state of Palestine in the pre-1967 lines, and to step up involvement in mediation.\n\nNabil Abu Rdeneh, an Abbas adviser, reiterated Sunday that \u201cthe U.S. is no longer acceptable as a mediator.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny plan from any side should be based on the basic references, which are the U.N. resolutions on the establishment of a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with east Jerusalem as a capital, and the Arab Peace Initiative, which addresses many issues, including the issue of refugees,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAny plan that is not based on the international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative will not be acceptable, neither by the Palestinians nor the Arabs.\u201d\n\nPence was also expected to meet with U.S. troops in the region on Sunday and then depart for Israel, where he\u2019s scheduled to hold meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, deliver an address to the Knesset and visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Karin Laub contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Vincenzo Pinto/AFP Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLIMA, Peru \u2014 Pope Francis is wrapping up the most contested, violent trip of his papacy Sunday with a series of meetings with Peruvian church leaders and a final Mass at an air base in Peru\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Mass is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of Peruvian faithful before his departure to Rome \u2014 a potentially stark contrast to the pontiff\u2019s send-off from Chile, where his final homily drew thousands less than anticipated and thin crowds lined the streets to wave goodbye.\n\n\u201cHopefully early tomorrow, myself and all of Peru will get a chance to see him up close,\u201d said Nicolas Astete, one of more than 3,000 people who gathered Saturday night outside the Apostolic Nunciature in Lima, hoping to see a glimpse of the pope before he retired for the evening.\n\n\u201cCome here!\u201d the crowds cried as Francis made his way to the papal embassy.\n\nDespite the thunderous welcome the pontiff has received throughout his trip to Peru, the uproar over the Catholic Church\u2019s handling of a clerical sex abuse scandal in Chile and Francis\u2019 own remarks on the case have continued to cast a shadow over the visit. All ears will be tuned in Sunday to any final words Francis might share on a crisis he had hoped to help mend in a visit to usually friendly Latin American turf.\n\nDuring his seven-day trip Chile and Peru Francis personally apologized to survivors of priests who sexually abused them, traveled deep into the Amazon to meet with indigenous leaders, decried the scourge of corruption and violence against women in Latin America and urged the Chilean government and radical Mapuche factions to peacefully resolve one of the region\u2019s longest-running disputes.\n\nBut the pope also attracted unprecedented rejection: At least a dozen churches across Chile were set aflame and riot police shot tear gas and arrested protesters who tried marching in on Mass in Santiago.\n\nFrancis stirred outrage when he accused victims of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile priest of slander. The 81-year-old Argentine said that until he sees proof that Bishop Juan Barros was complicit in covering up any crimes, accusations of complicity by the victims of against Barros are \u201call calumny.\u201d\n\nThat remark prompted even Francis\u2019 top adviser on clerical abuse to issue a stunning criticism of the pontiff, calling his words a \u201csource of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nThe rebuke Saturday came as Francis was consoling Peruvians in a coastal northern city hard hit by El Nino floods that left more than 150 dead nationwide last year. During Francis\u2019 three days in Peru he has also tackled heavy social issues, calling on corporations to stop exploitative drilling in the Amazon, for governments to recognize indigenous people and for greater transparency in politics.\n\nFrancis will conclude his trip by visiting some of Lima\u2019s holiest sites.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Cesar Barreto contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained at a historically low level, compared with past presidents. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAmericans have reached a split-screen assessment of the state of the country at the end of President Trump\u2019s first year in office, expressing the most positive views about the economy in nearly two decades while giving Trump historically low approval, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News survey.\n\nThis stark contrast between perceptions of the economy and assessments of the president continue a pattern that has existed since Trump was sworn in a year ago, that of a president whose personal actions and behavior have stirred controversy and created a political distraction in the face of steady growth, low unemployment and record gains in the stock market.\n\nHow voters weigh those two views will have a decided impact on the upcoming midterm elections. Democrats, who see an opportunity take back control of the House and have a possible although uphill path to control of the Senate, will seek to make the November elections about Trump. Republicans hope perceptions of the economy will influence enough voters to hold down their expected losses enough to protect that House majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new survey finds that 58 percent of all Americans give positive ratings to the state of the economy. That is the highest in a Post-ABC survey in 17 years and seven points higher than on the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration. At the same time, Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained at a historically low level, compared with past presidents. Today, 36 percent approve of the job Trump is doing, while 58 percent disapprove, little changed over the past few months. Strong disapproval of the president, at 49 percent overall, remains twice as high as strong approval, which stands at 24 percent.\n\n[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted]\n\nThe public is evenly divided overall and deeply split along partisan lines on three major policy initiatives of the Trump presidency \u2014 the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants, a reduction in federal regulations on businesses, and an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce. More than 4 in 10 support those policies, and an almost-identical percentage oppose them. But the level of support is slightly higher than Trump\u2019s approval rating, meaning that some Americans \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 who disapprove of the president support those policies.\n\nOn two of the biggest policy debates of the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 health care and taxes \u2014 the public comes down in opposition to the direction pursued by the administration and congressional Republicans. A majority (57 percent) say the continuation of the Affordable Care Act is a good thing, in essence an expression of relief that Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare as they had long promised to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the big tax bill passed by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump at the end of last year, 46 percent say it is bad for the country while 34 percent say it is good for the country. That is slightly better than when people were asked whether they supported or opposed the measure as it was being debated. Notably, 20 percent say they have no opinion or are ambivalent about the tax bill, which is likely to become a pivotal battleground for public opinion between the parties ahead of the November midterm elections.\n\nThe gap between the president\u2019s low approval and the somewhat higher level of support for some of his policies reflects the disconnect between how people see the president and how they view some of his priorities. For example, 21 percent of Democrats who disapprove of the president say the crackdown on undocumented immigrants is a good thing for the country. The same percentage of disapproving Democrats say reducing federal regulations on business is good for the country.\n\nFor their part, Democrats are struggling to convey a message beyond being anti-Trump, with just over 3 in 10 saying they are presenting alternatives to Trump\u2019s proposals. A 53 percent majority say the Democratic Party is mainly criticizing the president without offering alternatives.\n\nAs the president begins his second year in office, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and possible cooperation, collusion or knowledge of what was taking place by associates of the Trump campaign continues. Trump has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d although it has produced two guilty pleas, including one from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and charges against Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, and an associate of Manafort\u2019s.\n\nToday, 50 percent of Americans approve of the way Mueller is proceeding compared with 31 percent who disapprove, with 19 percent expressing no opinion. In early November, 58 percent approved of Mueller\u2019s handling, but in recent weeks, Republicans have targeted the investigation as biased. Among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, approval of Mueller has dropped from 39 percent in November to 30 percent in the new poll.\n\nHalf of all Americans also say they believe Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Russians, and an almost identical percentage say they believe the president tried to interfere with the investigation. Just over a quarter, 26 percent, say they believe there is solid evidence to buttress this latter assessment.\n\nThe impact of Trump\u2019s leadership on the public is mixed to negative. Six in 10 Americans say he has accomplished little or nothing. That is better than the 65 percent who said this in November, before passage of the tax bill, but it is a worse rating than received by former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at a similar point in their first terms. A bare majority (53 percent) say Trump\u2019s actions have made no difference to them and their families. The rest are roughly split about the effect of his presidency on them, with 26 percent saying his actions have hurt and 20 percent saying they\u2019ve helped.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the economy, Trump receives less credit for the gains seen over the past than does his predecessor, Obama. Fewer than 4 in 10, 38 percent, say the Trump administration deserves significant credit for the state of the economy while 50 percent say the Obama administration should get credit. Republicans and Democrats have sharply opposite views of where the credit should go. Among independents, one-third say Trump should get credit, compared with about half who give credit to Obama.\n\nAbout 1 in 4 Americans rate the economy positively while disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance. Three-quarters of them are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, and most of the group says Obama deserves credit for the current state of the economy, not Trump. Even more important is the fact that almost all of them say Trump has acted in a way that is not presidential, one indicator of how his personal behavior has clouded his presidency.\n\nThe survey finds that Trump and the Republicans have so far failed to shift public opinion on key elements of their agenda. Republican leaders have said that the new tax law \u2014 the party\u2019s biggest accomplishment to date \u2014 will provide lower taxes for most middle-class families. But at this point, 60 percent of Americans see the new measure overall as favoring the rich rather than the middle class or the poor.\n\nOpposition to Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to curtail illegal immigration remains strong, with 63 percent of Americans saying they are against it, including 52 percent who strongly oppose. But 71 percent of Republicans support the proposal, including 58 percent who support it strongly. The gulf between Republicans on one side and Democrats and independents on the other underscores why this part of border security has been a sticking point in budget negotiations between the two parties.\n\nCongress has been at a stalemate over the future of the Obama-era policy that protected from deportation undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children. The issue has been a point of contention in recent days as Congress has struggled to reach a spending agreement. Trump rescinded the Obama program last fall and asked Congress to come up with a solution by March. So far that fix has eluded negotiators.\n\nPublic opinion is clear on this issue, with 87 percent of Americans saying they support a continuation of the protection for those undocumented young people who have completed high school or served in the military and who have no serious criminal record. On this, there is bipartisan agreement among overwhelming majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\nTrump\u2019s behavior and fitness shape the other track of his presidency, to his detriment. Seven in 10 Americans say he has acted in a way that is not presidential, while a quarter say his behavior has been fitting and proper for the nation\u2019s chief executive. About 2 in 3 say the president\u2019s use of Twitter has hurt his presidency. A bare majority (52 percent) say he is biased against black people.\n\nThe president in a recent tweet, which came after a renewed round of questions about his stability in light of a new book that described him in unflattering terms, said he was both mentally stable and a \u201cgenius\u201d for being able to win the White House in his first try for public office. On those two questions, Americans are almost split evenly about his mental stability but by better than 3 to 1 say he is not a genius.\n\nTrump recently underwent a physical examination that included a test aimed at detecting mild cognitive impairment. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House\u2019s top physician, said the president had a perfect score on the test and dismissed questions about his mental competence.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll was conducted Jan. 15-18, 2018, among a random sample of 1,005 adults reached on cell and landline phones with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.", "title": "Poll finds public optimistic about the economy, critical of Trump, split on issues - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-finds-public-optimistic-about-the-economy-critical-of-trump-split-on-issues/2018/01/20/30cb803c-fd51-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T05:01:56Z"}, {"textData": "North Korean Hyon Song Wol, head of North Korea\u2019s art troupe, arrives at the Seoul Train Station in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, Jan. 21, 2018.

Gunmen stormed the hotel in the Afghan capital on Saturday evening, triggering a shootout with security forces, officials said. (Rahmat Gul/Associated Press)\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 A Taliban assault on the Intercontinental Hotel in Afghanistan\u2019s capital killed at least six people, including a foreigner, and pinned security forces down for more than 13 hours before the last attacker was killed on Sunday, with the casualty toll expected to rise.\n\nThe heavily-guarded luxury hotel is popular among foreigners and Afghan officials. Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said the six killed included a foreigner and a telecommunications official from the western Farah province who was attending a conference.\n\nSix other people, including three security forces, were reported wounded and more than 150 people, including 41 foreigners, were rescued from the hotel, Danish said.\n\nThe Taliban claimed the attack, which began around 9 p.m. Saturday, saying five gunmen armed with suicide vests targeted foreigners and Afghan officials. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the insurgents initially planned to attack the hotel Thursday night but postponed the assault because there was a wedding underway and they wanted to avoid civilian casualties.\n\nThe attack unfolded almost six years after Taliban insurgents launched a similar assault on the property, which is not part of the InterContinental chain of worldwide hotels.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said a private firm assumed responsibility for securing the hotel around three weeks ago. The ministry says it is investigating how the attackers managed to enter the building.\n\nAfghan security officials confirmed that 34 provincial officials were gathered at the hotel to participate in a conference organized by the Telecommunication Ministry.\n\nA fire broke out at the hotel as the fighting raged, and the sound of explosions could be heard throughout the standoff. Live TV footage showed people trying to escape through windows on the upper stories.\n\nCapt. Tom Gresback, spokesman for NATO-led forces, said in a statement that Afghan forces were leading the response efforts. He said that according to initial reports, no foreign troops were hurt in the attack.\n\nNeighboring Pakistan condemned the \u201cbrutal terrorist attack\u201d and called for greater cooperation against militants. Afghanistan and Pakistan routinely accuse each other of failing to combat extremists along their long and porous border.\n\nAfghan forces have struggled to combat the Taliban since the U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. They have also had to contend with a growing Islamic State affiliate that has carried out a number of massive attacks in recent years.\n\nIn the northern Balkh province, insurgents burst into a home where several members of a local pro-government militia were gathered late Saturday, leading them outside and killing 18 of them, said Gen.

(Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Koreans seem generally happy they\u2019ll see the North Koreans at their Olympics, but aren\u2019t as pleased about sharing a team with them.\n\nThe agreement between the war-separated rivals to field a unified women\u2019s ice hockey team at February\u2019s Winter Olympics has triggered a debate in South Korea, where there\u2019s no longer strong public clamor for reunification or for using sports to make political statements.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who views the Pyeongchang Games as an opportunity to improve relations following a year of tension over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, said the unified team would provide a \u201chistorically grand moment\u201d once it appears on ice.\n\nOther reconciliatory gestures the Koreas have agreed to for the Olympics include a joint march under a blue-and-white \u201cunification\u201d flag during the Feb. 9 opening ceremony and a pair of performances by a visiting North Korean art troupe. The joint march and the unified hockey team were approved Saturday by the International Olympic Committee, which allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the games in exceptional entries given to the North.\n\nNot all South Koreans are in the mood. There are apparently few objections to the North Korean presence at the Olympics itself, which likely ensures that the country holds off any significant weapons test or other aggressive acts that would risk disrupting the games.\n\nMany South Koreans believe their government went too far by pushing athletes into a \u201cpolitical show\u201d that will likely become meaningless once the lull in tensions breaks down after the Olympics.\n\nKim Hye-jin, a 39-year-old music instructor, said that South Korea was repeating an \u201coutdated approach\u201d in using sports diplomacy. She said that the previous unified teams and joint marches between the rivals never paved the way for sustained, meaningful engagement.\n\n\u201cWe are always repeating meaningless things and North Korea isn\u2019t a country that will change easily,\u201d she said.\n\nPlus, she said, a unified team takes away opportunities from South Korean athletes who have been working hard to prepare for the Olympics.\n\nHeo Doo-won, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, didn\u2019t care for the reconciliatory gestures at all.\n\n\u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe are clearly two different countries and it\u2019s better if things stay that way. I don\u2019t want a unified team or a unification flag. Why can\u2019t we just let the North Koreans march under their own flag?\u201d\n\nWhile the liberal Moon remains a popular president nine months into his term, the controversy over the hockey team factored in his approval rating dipping below 70 percent for the first time in four months, according to a Gallup Korea report on Friday.\n\nMany people sympathize with the South Korean athletes who would likely be sacrificing opportunities for the North\u2019s players, who are considered less skilled and experienced. The IOC approved an expanded roster of 35 instead of 22 for the joint team, but only the normal number will be allowed to suit up for each game and three of them must be North Korean.\n\nThe South Korean team\u2019s Canadian coach, Sarah Murray, has expressed concerns over chemistry.\n\n\u201cAdding somebody so close to the Olympics is a little bit dangerous just for team chemistry because the girls have been together for so long,\u201d she said last week.\n\nChoi Hyuk, a 40-year-old office worker, blamed the government for failing to properly communicate with the players and for excessively politicizing sports.\n\nChoi pointed to the comments of Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, who was forced to apologize after saying that the South Korean women\u2019s hockey team was out of \u201cmedal range\u201d anyway while defending the government\u2019s decision to create the unified team.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s elite sports have always been based on nationalism,\u201d Choi said, referring to a decades-long system that rewards Olympic medal winners with lifelong cash payments and exemption from military duties that are mandatory for most able-bodied men.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny that the same country is now asking athletes to cut back on their playing time and embrace changes that would make them less likely to win?\u201d\n\nThe reconciliation mood between the Koreas began after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year\u2019s speech that he was willing to send a delegation to the Olympics.\n\nSome experts view Kim\u2019s overture as an attempt to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and buy time to further advance his nuclear weapons program. Last year, North Korea carried out its sixth and biggest nuclear test and test-fired three intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has shown no willingness to give up its ambitions.\n\nStill, many experts think Moon\u2019s government made the right move in jumping at the opportunity to resume contact with North Korea after nearly two years of diplomatic stalemate and animosity.\n\nIn an annual policy report on Friday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said it aims to use the Olympics as an opportunity to re-establish regular dialogue with North Korea. The resumption of inter-Korean talks is crucial for the policies of Moon, who wants Seoul in the driver\u2019s seat in international efforts to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat.\n\nThe Koreas sent joint teams to major international sporting events twice in 1991, and had their athletes march together in the opening and closing ceremonies of several sporting events in the 2000s, including the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile the previous moves had little diplomatic impact, similar gestures would carry more meaning in an Olympics held on South Korean soil and amid higher stakes in regional security, said Yongchul Chung, a sports education professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.\n\n\u201cFielding a unified team is very meaningful \u2014 the biggest fruit that can come from the Pyeongchang Olympics is a message of peace between the Koreas,\u201d Chung said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the players wouldn\u2019t understand the historic significance of what they are involved in.\u201d\n\nBut it has become harder to get South Koreans excited for unified teams and joint marches when North Korea\u2019s increasingly aggressive weapons tests and the South\u2019s own evolvement as an economy and society continue to erode the public\u2019s enthusiasm for reunification.\n\nIn a survey of 1,200 adults released by Seoul National University in October, 53.8 percent of the respondents said they supported the idea of reunification. This represented a steep drop from the 63.8 percent measured in 2007, when the school started the annual survey.\n\n\u201cI think it will be emotionally moving to watch the athletes of both Koreas march under the same flag during the opening ceremony as we come from the same nation,\u201d said Oh Ju-yeon, a 46-year-old housewife. \u201cBut after the games, there will be bitterness from realizing that nothing\u2019s really going to change.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A blatant falsehood from the White House podium.\n\nAnd that was just the first 24 hours.\n\nIn his first year in office, Donald Trump proved to be a singular figure, casting aside norms and traditions, fighting with Republicans and Democrats alike and changing how the nation and the presidency are viewed at home and abroad.\n\nSeemingly each day spawned several can-you-believe-it headlines that would have defined a previous president\u2019s term. But in the hyper-accelerated Trump news cycle, many were forgotten by the next morning.\n\nAppropriate for a former reality TV star, Trump\u2019s first year was can\u2019t-miss drama, full of unforgettable characters, surprise casting changes and innumerable plot twists. It came against the backdrop of a deeply polarized nation, a looming nuclear threat, whispers about the president\u2019s fitness for office and, for good measure, the shadow of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe reviews weren\u2019t kind. Trump\u2019s first-year approval rating stood at 39 percent, the lowest of any president. But viewers couldn\u2019t look away.\n\n\u201cHe is a compulsively watchable political character,\u201d said Jon Meacham, presidential historian and biographer. \u201cThe country elected the most unconventional president in our history and he has proven to be just that. To me, the story of the first year is the atmospheric chaos that the president has created, sustained and perpetuated.\u201d\n\nTrump was the first president to be elected without any government or military experience. And from the first moments of Trump\u2019s inauguration, it was clear that Washington had never seen anything like this before.\n\nHis inaugural speech was a dark pitch to the nation\u2019s forgotten, suggesting a retreat from the world under the slogan of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d It soon led to an uproar over the White House press secretary\u2019s wild claims about the inauguration crowd size.\n\nSoon, other crowds were the story.\n\nMillions of people flooded streets around the globe for the \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d to protest Trump\u2019s presidency. That set the template for the so-called #Resistance, which swarmed airports just days later when the White House suddenly announced its travel ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThere would be little attempt from Trump to bring those protesters into the fold. Despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, the president forged forward as if elected with a sweeping mandate, aiming his policies directly at his base \u2014 with moves such as the rollback of environment regulations and civil rights protections \u2014 and blaming Democrats for any Washington failure.\n\nAlways eager to have a foe, Trump governed as he campaigned, and not just by incessantly reliving his 2016 election over Hillary Clinton. Trump frequently instigated fights and rarely let a slight go unanswered via his favorite weapon, his Twitter account.\n\nAny pre-inauguration talk of restraining his Twitter usage was soon forgotten. He used the 140-character \u2014 and later, up to 280 \u2014 bursts to target foes, traffic in conspiracy theories, salute the programming on Fox News, rattle Congress and unnerve world capitals. In March, he even made the unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor had wiretapped Trump Tower, and he labeled President Barack Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy.\u201d\n\nThe trail of tweets has roiled the capital for 12 months. Across Washington, phones would buzz with alerts anytime Trump tweeted. Republicans found themselves to be targets of Trump\u2019s tweet just like Democrats, particularly when their efforts to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 a plan seven years in the making \u2014 failed not once, but twice.\n\nSome tweets drew puzzlement; none more than the president\u2019s late-night posting of the nonsensical word \u201ccovfefe.\u201d\n\nSome tweets challenged American institutions, full of criticisms of the media and the FBI. Others provoked outrage, as when he suggested that MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski had a face-lift or claimed that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., \u201cwould do anything\u201d for a donation, an unsavory insinuation made at the height of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe discussion about sexual harassment toppled many powerful men but, while Trump\u2019s own accusers resurfaced, the White House never changed its story: The women were lying.\n\nThat was just one of many moments in which Trump appeared almost eager to foment divisions, including racial ones.\n\nHis political career was launched on the lie that Obama was not born in the United States, and this month, Trump was denounced for dismissing African nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d when he urged a limit on immigration from that continent.\n\nHe dismissed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d mocking her claims about being part Native American, while addressing a group of American Indians. More divisively, he blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence between neo-Nazis and anti-hate group protesters that left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nWhile Trump was rewriting the rules of behavior within the Oval Office, his agenda was largely lifted from the Republican playbook and his first year victories thrilled the GOP orthodoxy. He appointed conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, rolled back business regulations, presided over a massive tax cut and, the White House argued, fostered an environment that freed the stock market to boom.\n\n\u201c2017 was a year of tremendous achievement (and) the achievements for our country, our people, and for our standing in the world have been very monumental,\u201d Trump said at a Cabinet meeting last week, before offering a glimpse into how he views the presidency \u2014 as catnip for cable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure their ratings were fantastic. They always are,\u201d he said.\n\nLike any president, Trump faced crises during his first year.\n\nMost ominously, North Korea escalated its nuclear weapons development program while Trump responded with unprecedentedly bellicose rhetoric. He warned of \u201cfire and fury\u201d that could wipe out Pyongyang. At the United Nations, he insulted North Korean leader Kim Jung Un as \u201cLittle Rocket Man.\u201d Trump took to Twitter to suggest that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim\u2019s.\n\nThe anniversary of his inauguration coincided with a government shutdown, and he scoffed that Democrats \u201cwanted to give me a nice present.\u201d\n\nHe traveled overseas four times, upbraiding traditional American allies at NATO for not paying enough, basking in the flattery of Chinese President Xi Jinping and touching a mysterious, glowing orb with Saudi King Salman.\n\nHis responses to domestic tragedies were uneven.\n\nHe paid tribute to the 58 victims of a shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas, but made no effort to toughen gun control laws. When Hurricane Maria crushed Puerto Rico, leaving half the island without power for months, Trump feuded with a local mayor and, during a visit, distributed paper towels to survivors by shooting them like they were basketballs.\n\nBefitting a man whose reality show ended with a firing each week, in Trump\u2019s first year his administration\u2019s upper-level officials have had a turnover rate of 34 percent, much higher than any other in the past 40 years. Gone were chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer and, after just 11 eventful days, communications director Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nBut the circumstances of two exits above all may define not just Trump\u2019s first year in office, but those to follow.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Flynn was fired less than a month into the term for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with foreign officials. In May, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\nThat dismissal led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose probe into possible collusion and obstruction of justice has hovered over the White House. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and is now cooperating with Mueller. Trump himself may at some point be interviewed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a president who had such a chaotic first year. Every day is topsy-turvy and disorganized, the country has not been so divided since the Civil War and Trump thrives at being the bull that carries his own china shop around with him,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cHe\u2019s not like anything we\u2019ve seen before and this is the question: What are the consequences going to be?\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It was also Republicans, who grumbled just as loudly that they were not sure who in the White House was negotiating to end a partial government shutdown.\n\nWhich Trump was it: The ultimate deal-maker eager to deliver what eluded his predecessors from both parties or the firebrand who rode a hardline immigration stance to power? As with so many other moments of consequence for his presidency, it seemed the last person to speak with Trump determined his position.\n\nFor the President, it was not how he anticipated spending the one-year anniversary of his inauguration.\n\nThe White House\u2019s budget director and legislative liaison made the rounds at the Capitol. Its press secretary called lawmakers \u201closers.\u201d The chief of staff seemed to reverse his boss\u2019 compromises with Senate Democrats and protect the President\u2019s right flank. Trump, surrounded by protesters outside the White House gates, was trolling them on Twitter and raging that Congress was not bending to his will.\n\nSome Republicans marveled that the focus for many leaders in the party was on shifting blame and scoring wins, not finding a way to reopen the government.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a lead negotiator in the immigration talks that are central to the crisis. \u201cThe idea of letting this continue to fester is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, remained unwilling to incorporate protections for the roughly 800,000 young people who were brought to the country illegally as children. Democrats have conditioned their votes to fund the government on protections for those young people, known as Dreamers. Trump last year ended temporary protections for those individuals and told Congress to pass a replacement.\n\nOn Saturday, top White House officials optimistically called it \u201ca tangential issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House position remains the same: we will not negotiate the status of 690,000 unlawful immigrants while hundreds of millions of tax-paying Americans \u2026 are held hostage by Senate Democrats,\u201d White House legislative director Marc Short told reporters on Saturday. \u201cWe hope Senate Democrats will yield.\u201d\n\nBut the rhetoric didn\u2019t invite compromise. \u201cIt\u2019s like a two-year-old\u2019s temper tantrum,\u201d Short said.\n\nThe White House budget director Mick Mulvaney insisted all talk of the funding lapse should be branded \u201cSchumer Shutdown,\u201d after Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cIt has that nice little ring to it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Mulvaney said, again arguing that talks with Schumer were fruitless. \u201cAt what point does it even become profitable to continue to work with someone like that?\u201d\n\nBut if Republicans hope to reopen the government, the White House will need to work with Schumer and his caucus, where retreat was not an appealing option as Day One of the shutdown unfolded. Schumer\u2019s top deputy, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, briefed House Democrats on Saturday morning behind closed doors. From outside, cheers were audible, signaling a compromise was unlikely.\n\n\u201cThe President created this challenge on September 5th,\u201d Durbin told TIME outside the Capitol in the early hours of Saturday morning as he prepared to make his way home after a long night. It was on Sept. 5 that Trump declared an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, that protected many of the Dreamers.\n\n\u201cThe Republican-controlled House and Senate have not produced a single bill to respond to this,\u201d an exhausted Durbin said. \u201cThe President put the fates of these young people in doubt, and we have a responsibility to do something to help them.\u201d\n\nThat call to action was echoed throughout the day as lawmakers marveled how a program Trump backed as late as last week suddenly was the sticking point.\n\n\u201cThe only way out of this is for the President to take \u2018yes\u2019 for an answer,\u201d said Schumer, who met with the President for 90 minutes over cheeseburgers late Friday afternoon. Schumer thought he was close to an off-ramp and indicated he could convince his colleagues to give the President some of the money needed for his border wall.\n\nFrantically, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell phoned the White House urging the President to stand firm against any deal shorter than four weeks and to void any hopes of compromise with Schumer. He also phoned House Speaker Paul Ryan and urged him to hold the line against compromise.\n\nAt the White House, advisers told the President that the Democrats\u2019 offer was only for one year of border building, not the whole costs. That, for the moment, talked him away from dealmaker and back toward his hardline stance.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly phoned Schumer on Friday to tell him that a short-term deal was not possible under these conditions.\n\n\u201cNegotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\u201d Schumer fumed from the Senate floor midday Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to that President? He backed off at the first sign of pressure,\u201d Schumer said, casting the President as a choke artist \u2014 a gamble that could provoke Trump.\n\nRepublicans continued to shove blame on the Democrats. They accused their colleagues across the aisle of placing politics above the health and well-being of American children, since the failed spending package contained funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which lapsed in September. They rejected the notion that their own party \u2014 which controls both chambers of Congress, and which has failed to bring CHIP to the floor in the four months since it lapsed \u2014 bore any responsibility.\n\n\u201cBottom line, this was a clean bill, and it\u2026 is so obvious that they are putting the Obama legacy ahead taking care of children and supporting our troops,\u201d Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins of West Virginia told TIME.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Capitol on Saturday, other House Republicans held their ground. Throughout this entire process \u2014 the tentative progress towards an immigration deal last week; the negotiations of a spending bill after that progress collapsed \u2014 these lawmakers had been the biggest hurdle to compromise. Unlike their more moderate colleagues in the Senate, a powerful faction of conservatives in the House is rigidly opposed to a bipartisan solution on DACA, preferring instead a hardline bill that would restrict immigration and amplify domestic enforcement.\n\nBut when asked if her colleagues would be amenable to an immigration compromise, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the fourth-ranking House Republican, demurred. \u201cThe first order of business is to get the government funded,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more time [on immigration] \u2014 and that should not be used to put the country through this shutdown.\u201d\n\nThere were whispers of disagreement among Republican leaders on the Hill. Reports indicated McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan were not on the same page; aides to each disputed those reports strongly.\n\nYet, there are limits to how much McConnell can unilaterally do. Spending bills have to start in the House, and it\u2019s not clear Republicans in both chambers were of the same mind, or where the President might be on a final compromise. Ryan has a rowdy caucus to manage, McConnell will need Democratic votes to reach the 60-vote threshold to fund the government, and the President has proven unpredictable.\n\nFor his part, McConnell sought a way out of the crisis that didn\u2019t hinge on the President\u2019s consistency. He offered a possible deal to reopen the government through Feb. 8 \u2014 or so \u2014 and fund a health insurance program for poor kids for six years in exchange for a pledge that talks will resume on an immigration deal that would protect Dreamers. The three-week funding bill is a one-week reduction from the proposal that failed late Friday, a difference that seemed to make no difference to Democrats, especially if promises from the President were in the mix.\n\n\u201cThis President just does not have a reputation for telling the truth,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California.\n\nAs the Democrats huddled to discuss their options, they looked up to see split-screen coverage of a stand-still Capitol and scores of women marching against Trump\u2019s agenda. Any skittishness about the decision to shutter government melted as they saw the grassroots activists filling streets from San Diego to New York. Republicans are worried they could lose their majorities in the House and maybe the Senate in this fall\u2019s elections, and maintaining this energy among liberal activists is crucial.\n\n\u201cAll I can tell you is there are a lot of meetings going on. I just came from one,\u201d Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent, told TIME on Saturday afternoon as he walked down a hallway in the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The building was quiet and seemingly empty. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d say I\u2019m optimistic, but I\u2019d say that everyone wants to get to a positive result.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, too, were clearly frustrated. Against long odds, Ryan had cobbled together enough votes for a one-month funding plan by promising the most conservatives lawmakers a vote on a hardline immigration plan that has little chance of clearing the House, let alone find support in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe do some crazy things in Washington but this is utter madness,\u201d the Speaker said, brimming with frustration. He later sent that observation to his email list.\n\nIt echoed McConnell\u2019s pre-shutdown pique. Even as the government was hurtling toward running out of cash, the top Republican in the Senate said he wasn\u2019t sure what it would take to get the the President\u2019s sign-off. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something that President Trump supports,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not yet indicated what measure he\u2019s willing to sign.\u201d\n\nIn fact, some in the President\u2019s negotiating team told lawmakers to pitch a Homeland Security outline of immigration demands. Hardliners inside the White House said the list was incomplete, and the President seemed to side with them. That effectively undercut Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a close Kelly ally, and sent everyone back into a chaos so familiar after a year of the Trump presidency.\n\nThat left many White House aides and their Republican counterparts on the brink of rage and undercutting each other in meetings. \u201cHow do we win against Congress if we can\u2019t even agree among ourselves? We can\u2019t even figure out what a win looks like,\u201d a frustrated White House staffer said. \u201cNo one here knows how this ends.\u201d", "title": "The People Who Started the Shutdown Don\u2019t Know How to End It", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5111513/shutdown-day-two-congress/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T02:48:30Z"}, {"textData": "Photo\n\nThe leader of the Hawaii National Guard told state lawmakers on Friday that he informed the governor that a panic-inducing missile alert was a false alarm two minutes after it had been sent to cellphones statewide.\n\nThe leader, Maj.

But the area\u2019s newest incubator is taking a different approach: doubling down on federal contracts while trying to open that market to a more diverse group of people.\n\nTo help small businesses grow and compete for government work, a Rockville, Md.-based consulting business called OST Global Solutions is starting an incubator focused on helping its members scale within the federal market.\n\nDespite an array of new set-aside programs meant to give small firms an advantage, the number of small companies holding primary government contracts has shrunk substantially since 2010. OST founders Olessia Smotrova and David Huff say insider knowledge \u2014 and not resources \u2014 is the main thing that keeps small firms out of the market.\n\n\u201cIt literally is the divide between those who know what to do and those that don\u2019t,\u201d Smotrova said.\n\nMembers can go through the program remotely or co-work at OST\u2019s offices, paying between $275 and $695 a month. The coursework focuses on the nuts and bolts of following government bid proposals and keeping government decision-makers happy, as well as the intangible aspects of entre\u00adpre\u00adneur\u00adship and business management.\n\nThe secret to their work, Smotrova says, is getting members to hold themselves to ambitious growth metrics by constantly competing for new work. Too often government contractors are content to rest on their laurels once they win a contract, she says.\n\n\u201cA lot of government contractors don\u2019t have that sense of urgency to fill their pipeline,\u201d Smotrova says.\n\nThe program commits members to an ambitious growth path of 400 or 500 percent, and gives them customized goals they must reach before they can graduate.\n\n\u201cWe can diagnose where they are failing and why they are failing,\u201d Smotrova said.\n\nOne of the first members to opt for the co-working program is Virginia-based VG Systems LLC, an eight-person IT firm that brings in between $1.5 million and $2 million a year in revenue.\n\nChief executive Thomas Perry says he\u2019s hoping OST can help him get a more stable stream of income. The company\u2019s earnings can vary widely based on what work is available.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wild roller coaster,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re trying to go through the incubator is we\u2019re trying to make that a little more of a smooth upward growth curve.\u201d\n\nSmall businesses that are working in the federal space usually do so with the help of official \u201cset-aside\u201d programs designed to give such firms an advantage.\n\nOne is Ogden, Utah-based Wynsor LLC, a 10-person firm that makes a steady business of decontaminating old uranium mines, among other environmentally oriented work for the federal government.\n\nLea Ann Rodriquez founded Wynsor in 2007 while she was still working at the Idaho National Laboratory, which she left in 2009. Today her firm is working on uranium mines in Oklahoma and Washington state, and also holds a contract to decontaminate respirator machines at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nIt took her three years to get through the paperwork required for the Small Business Association\u2019s 8a small disadvantaged business certification program, which gives her an automatic leg up on certain federal contracts.\n\nBut the market is getting more competitive, even among the small businesses that qualify for set-asides. And her advantage under that program expires in 2021 when the eight-year program times out.\n\nShe wants to keep her company after 2021, but to do so she\u2019ll have to grow before the company \u201cgraduates\u201d and loses its certification under that program. She\u2019s hoping OST can teach her how to compete for work without having the help of a set-aside program.\n\n\u201cA lot of [8a program participants] graduate and their sales just plummet,\u201d Rodriquez says.\n\nOthers joining the incubator are leveraging deep connections to the U.S. military. One is Gib Godwin, a former two-star Navy rear admiral who runs a consulting firm.\n\nGodwin retired from the Navy in 2006 and briefly worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers and Northrop Grumman before setting off on his own. His company, BriteWerx LLC, competes for federal work under a set-aside program for service-disabled veterans.\n\nHis only full-time employee is his daughter, who holds the title of chief financial officer. Their small partnership takes in between $850,000 and $950,000 each year in revenue, most of it through a single Navy contract the firm received through a sole-sourced award.\n\nAs a former Navy officer, there are certain lines he can\u2019t cross. He has a lifetime ban against winning large contracts related to the F-18 Hornet and F/A 18 Super Hornet fighter planes, for example, because he served as a chief engineer on those programs while in the Navy. He has similar limitations on certain Navy and Marine Corps IT systems.\n\nBut his rank has mostly helped the business, he says.\n\n\u201cMy flag officer network has been a huge help,\u201d Godwin said. \u201cBecause of what you\u2019ve done before, you can get a meeting without crawling through broken glass on your belly.\u201d", "title": "Business incubator aims to help small firms win government work - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/business-incubator-aims-to-help-small-firms-win-government-work/2018/01/20/424fb02e-fd53-11e7-8f66-2df0b94bb98a_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T02:19:14Z"}, {"textData": "The budget resolution is a blueprint \u2014 a series of goals and instructions that lawmakers are supposed to follow. Think of it as a sort of congressional mission statement, meant to ensure that the process is not driven solely by executive branch priorities. The resolution is then supposed to be followed by a series of spending bills, hashed out in congressional committees, by the beginning of the government\u2019s fiscal year, which was set in October.\n\nBut in the 1990s, after decades of Congress being mostly controlled by Democrats, Republicans took power, and in the process upended the long-held assumption that Democrats would almost always be in charge. This changed the political incentive structure for both parties. The old model assumed that the main point of conflict was between two branches of government, Congress and the White House, and thus rewarded collaboration and legislative trading between parties.\n\nBut with the possibility that Congress could change hands more often, the new incentive was to use the budget process as a tool of partisan skirmishing that would make it easier to retain or regain control of the legislature. Instead of negotiating to achieve policy goals while maintaining a unified front against the executive, Congress was at war with itself.\n\nA result is that Congress hasn\u2019t completed the entire budget process, with all the spending bills, on time in more than 20 years. Many years, it has not passed any budget resolution at all. This is perhaps the most basic responsibility of the legislative branch, yet for decades, Congress has repeatedly come up short.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Republicans talked about changing this. Senator Mitch McConnell promised that he would pass a budget every year if and when Republicans gained a Senate majority. But in 2016 there was no budget resolution at all, which led us to the unusual situation we saw last year, where there were two budget resolutions, one to set up the failed Republican health care bill and another, later in the year, to set up tax reform.\n\nThat Congress can fail to pass a budget with so little consequence \u2014 if anything, it boosted Republicans, by giving them two opportunities to try major partisan legislation \u2014 shows what a cynical charade the process has become. The eventual budget resolutions that were passed reveal how disconnected the process has become from actual budgetary considerations. The Republican resolution a year ago was what\u2019s known as a \u201cshell budget\u201d \u2014 essentially just a set of instructions that would have allowed the health care bill to be passed with a simple majority vote.\n\nThe health care bill, whatever its merits, was not a budget, or a central component of anyone\u2019s conception of what a budget should be. But that\u2019s what the budget resolution was used for. And that is, in many ways, the problem: The budget process is not really about budgeting anymore.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn other years, the budget process has become bogged down, and Congress has kept the government funded through temporary extensions known as continuing resolutions (C.R.s) that fund government operations based on current levels, or rolled everything into an omnibus \u2014 or in some cases, a \u201cCRomnibus,\u201d combining a budget omnibus bill and a continuing resolution. It\u2019s kludgy language to describe a kludgy process.\n\nThe reliance on an ad hoc system of budgeting has made it even more difficult for Congress to keep the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order. The continuing resolution passed by the House this week would have added about $30 billion to the national debt.\n\nThe stalemates that have come to define the budget process have helped set the stage for repeated shutdown showdowns. It is a broken process that has enabled and empowered partisan bad faith by setting up a situation in which everything is riding on a few enormous bills. So lawmakers try to hook other priorities \u2014 immigration, say, or health care \u2014 to \u201cmust pass\u201d legislation in hopes of using the leverage to push them through.\n\nFrom a purely tactical perspective, pursuing political objectives to the point of a shutdown is rarely an effective strategy. The last government shutdown, in 2013, grew out of Republican opposition to Obamacare, which at the time was an unpopular program. The shutdown started on the same day the health law\u2019s insurance exchanges opened, and crashed \u2014 but during the few weeks the government was closed, Obamacare actually grew more popular. I am highly sympathetic to the plight of the Dreamers who have become central to the current fight, but I would not be surprised if this shutdown goes for Democrats the way the last one did for Republicans.\n\nAs long as the current system remains in place, and partisan volatility remains high, these showdowns are likely to recur. There are, however, a variety of options for reform, ranging from small tweaks to total overhauls.\n\nJames Capretta of the American Enterprise Institute has proposed forcing the White House to be more involved in the process by making the budget resolution a law signed by the president, thus encouraging cross-branch negotiation. Another possibility raised by Molly Reynolds of the Brookings Institution would be to find ways to limit legislative attachments that are mostly meant to make the other party look bad. Moving to a two-year budget process might ease annual pressures. Or, per Yuval Levin, the editor of National Affairs, a ground-up reimagining of the process might be in order.\n\nReforms won\u2019t be easy under the best of circumstances. And the blame game now playing out in Washington shows that the shutdown itself has become a vehicle for partisan point scoring. The first step toward fixing the system is for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to decide that their priority is to fulfill essential governing responsibilities \u2014 and stop treating the shutdown as a game to be won.", "title": "Op-Ed Contributor: The Shutdown Shows the Twisted Rules of a Broken Congress", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/opinion/shutdown-broken-congress-budget.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T02:17:22Z"}, {"textData": "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 6.3 earthquake has struck northern Chile.\n\nThe quake, which was deep at 110 kilometers (68 miles), struck at 10:06 p.m. local time Saturday.

(Han Jong-chan/Yonhap via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The head of a hugely popular North Korean girl band crossed the heavily fortified border into South Korea on Sunday to check preparations for rare performances by an art troupe she also leads during next month\u2019s Winter Olympics.\n\nAppearing live on South Korean television, Hyon Song Wol didn\u2019t speak when she walked past a crowd of reporters, onlookers and a barrage of camera flashes before boarding an express train at Seoul\u2019s railway station for the eastern city of Gangneung, where her art troupe is to perform during the Pyeongchang Olympics.\n\nShe is the leader of Pyongyang\u2019s all-female Moranbong Band, which was hand-picked by leader Kim Jong Un. She\u2019s been the subject of intense South Korean media attention since she attended last week\u2019s talks at the border that struck an agreement on the 140-memer Samjiyon art troupe\u2019s two performances \u2014 one in Seoul and the other in Gangneung, where some of the games will take place. After the talks, North Korea said Hyon would also lead the Samjiyon art troupe, whose performances would be the first by a North Korean group in South Korea since 2002.\n\nWith no official media access given to Hyon, TV stations broadcast live footage of her bus moving on Seoul\u2019s roads before arriving at the railway station, where hundreds of police officers were mobilized to maintain order. Photos showed a smiling Hyon shaking heads with a South Korean official upon arrival at the border. Later Sunday, wearing a dark winter coat and fur scarf and with half her hair tied to the back, she looked more serious with an expressionless face.\n\nHyon\u2019s arrival came hours after the International Olympic Committee allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the Olympics in exceptional entries given to the North. Among the 22 are 12 women who will join South Korea\u2019s female hockey team in the Koreas\u2019 first-ever unified Olympic team. The other sports events the North Koreans will compete in are figure skating, short track speed skating, Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe 22 North Korean athletes will march together with South Korean players under a single \u201cunification flag\u201d depicting their peninsula during the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang. \u201cSuch an agreement would have seemed impossible only a few weeks ago,\u201d IOC chief Thomas Bach said in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe current mood of reconciliation between the Koreas flared after Kim abruptly expressed his willingness to improve ties and send a delegation to the Olympics during his annual New Year\u2019s address. Outside critics dismissed Kim\u2019s overture as a tactic to use improved ties with Seoul to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions over North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear and missile programs.\n\nHyon, who is also an alternate member of the ruling party\u2019s Central Committee, is travelling with six other North Koreans. Her delegation had been expected in South Korea on Saturday, but North Korea canceled that plan on Friday night before it proposed a two-day trip starting Sunday. It wasn\u2019t clear why the visit was rescheduled.\n\nHyon\u2019s advance team is to inspect a venue for her art troupe\u2019s performance in Gangnenug later Sunday. The team is expected to stay overnight at Gangneung before returning to Seoul to check another venue in the capital on Monday, according to Yonhap news agency.\n\nThe Samjiyon art troupe, which comprises orchestra members, singers and dancers, is part of North Korea\u2019s Olympic delegation that also includes athletes, officials, journalists and a taekwondo demonstration team.\n\nNorth Korea on Sunday offered to send another advance team across the border on Thursday to look at accommodation facilities, a press center and the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies, according to Seoul\u2019s Unification Ministry. South Korea is to send its own advance team to North Korea on Tuesday to review logistics for a joint cultural event at the North\u2019s Diamond Mountain and their non-Olympic skiers\u2019 joint practices at the North\u2019s Masik ski resort, the ministry said.\n\nHyon was a popular singer before she was appointed to lead the Moranbong Band, which serves as the \u201csoft\u201d public face of the Kim government. Its members in short skirts and high heels or stylish military uniforms sing and dance odes to Kim. There is speculation that some of the Moranbong members may also appear in the Samjiyon art troupe, which observers say was likely hastily formed ahead of Olympics-related talks with South Korea.\n\nUnder a deal with South Korea, the Samjiyon group is to play folk songs and classic masterpieces that are well-known to both Koreas and fit in with the theme of unification. An attempt by the group to perform any propaganda piece would trigger protests from conservatives in South Korea. The Moranbong Band canceled its planned 2015 performance in Beijing at the last minutes after Beijing wanted to replace a missile launch scene from the background of the stage, according to South Korea media.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Meehan eventually attempted to pursue a romantic relationship with the aide and became hostile when she rejected his advances, the Times said.\nThe advances reportedly made the aide, who remains anonymous, so uncomfortable that she filed a complaint against Meehan, began working from home and, eventually, quit.\nMeehan was booted from the House Ethics Committee on Saturday,\u00a0hours after the Times story was published.

The aide filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment after she said Meehan became hostile toward her.\u00a0\nThe former aide told the Times that those tasked with handling the complaint, including two representatives for Meehan and two lawyers for the Office of House Employment Counsel,\u00a0suggested she had misinterpreted Meehan\u2019s behavior, leaving her feeling demoralized.\u00a0\nMeehan and his former aide eventually reached a settlement and nondisclosure agreement after mandatory counseling and mediation sessions, according to the Times.\nOver the past few months, the House Ethics Committee has been investigating several members of congress who are facing sexual harassment allegations or who have reached settlements with their accusers.

Blake Farenthold\u00a0(R-Texas),\u00a0Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.).\nIn light of those investigations, both Farenthold (who reportedly used $84,000 in taxpayer money to settle his claim) and Kihuen announced they would not be running for re-election; Franks resigned from Congress.\nLawmakers in the House have issued more than $100,000 in taxpayer-funded settlements for sexual harassment claims made between 2008 to 2012, HuffPost reported in December.\u00a0\nHouse and Senate legislators have since\u00a0introduced proposals\u00a0to ban the use of taxpayer-funded settlements.\nAfter speaking with Meehan on Saturday, Ryan said Meehan was submitting himself to the Ethics Committee for review, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement to HuffPost.\nRyan also urged Meehan to repay the funds he used in his settlement.\n\u201cThe new reforms going into place bar the use of taxpayer money to pay settlements, and so the speaker has also told Mr. Meehan that he should repay whatever taxpayer funds were used to settle this case,\u201d Strong said on Ryan\u2019s behalf.", "title": "House Ethics Committee Drops GOPer Over Taxpayer-Funded Harassment Settlement", "sourceId": "the-huffington-post", "sourceName": "The Huffington Post", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patrick-meehan-sexual-harassment-settlement_us_5a63b3f4e4b00228300356d5", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T01:14:36Z"}, {"textData": "1\n\nDesktop notifications are on | Turn off\n\nGet breaking news alerts from The Washington Post", "title": "Inside Moscow's Metro", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-sight/wp/2018/01/19/inside-the-theater-of-moscows-metro/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T01:09:36Z"}, {"textData": "\n\nMike Vrabel, the former linebacker who has been on the Texans\u2019 defensive staff for the past four seasons, is staying in the AFC South. (Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press)\n\nThe Tennessee Titans announced the hiring of Mike Vrabel, a three-time Super Bowl champion and tenured NFL assistant, as their new head coach Saturday. They will formally introduce Vrabel, 42, at a news conference Monday.\n\nVrabel was the Houston Texans\u2019 defensive coordinator in 2017 after spending the previous three seasons as linebackers coach. Vrabel replaces Mike Mularkey, who was fired Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredible opportunity and one I have been preparing for my entire football life,\u201d Vrabel said in the Titans\u2019 news release.\n\nVrabel played linebacker for the New England Patriots from 2001 to 2008 following a four-year stint with the Pittsburgh Steelers, finishing his career with a pair of seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs. He lined up as a tight end in occasional goal-line formations for the Patriots and famously caught touchdown passes from Tom Brady in the 2003 and 2004 Super Bowls. He finished his career with 10 receptions, all for touchdowns.\n\nThe hiring suggests the Titans will tilt toward defense after a 2017 season in which they made the playoffs for the first time since 2008 and won their first-round game at Kansas City before falling to the Patriots in a divisional-round matchup. But the Texans ranked last in the NFL in scoring defense, allowing 27.2 points per game. The Titans were 17th, allowing 22.2.\n\nVrabel will have to coax a better year out of quarterback Marcus Mariota, whose passer rating dropped from 95.6 to 79.3 in 2017. He also threw 13 fewer touchdown passes and six more interceptions than he did in his breakout 2016 season.\n\nTitans General Manager Jon Robinson noted in the team\u2019s announcement that he thinks Vrabel can find solutions for both issues. Vrabel was the first candidate of three whom Robinson interviewed; Tennessee also considered Panthers defensive coordinator Steve Wilks and Rams offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur.\n\nRobinson was a scout for the Patriots from 2002 to 2013, giving him first-hand knowledge of Vrabel\u2019s strengths.\n\n\u201cI saw him up close as a player for the Patriots and saw how he prepared himself to be successful on a daily basis,\u201d Robinson said in the team\u2019s release. \u201cHe was the ultimate team-first player, and he embodies that same mind-set as a coach. He is intelligent, energetic, detailed and a leader whose deep passion for this game will resonate with our players. As a coach, I have seen him develop talent at both the college and NFL level, and put players in position for them to be successful.

In the Hollywood-inspired popular images of the 1950s, the great white hunter was a fearless Clark Gable or Stewart Granger, tall and deeply tanned, who brought down a charging rhino with a single shot while his arrogant client cowered behind him, and who later romanced the client\u2019s neglected wife after saving her from a snarling lion.\n\nThe reality was Mr. Selby: short and stocky, mild and self-effacing, a man who seemed to listen with his eyes. He had curly hair, a boyishly shy smile and a wife and two children. He catered to men used to giving orders, not taking them, but did it with tact, avoiding upbraiding a client needlessly and almost never finding it necessary to save anyone. Neither he nor any client was ever seriously injured on a safari, though there were some close calls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was not all shooting and campfire tales. A Selby safari required an army of bearers, cooks, skinners, porters, drivers and others; game licenses and financial transactions; transportation arrangements, from trucks and horses to planes and boats; and a complex coordination of supplies and equipment: guns and ammunition, food, water, tents, cots, radios, medicines, maps, clothing and a thousand other necessities.\n\nWithout cellphones or evacuation helicopters, Mr. Selby had to be the doctor, mechanic, chauffeur, gin-rummy-and-drinking partner and universal guide, knowledgeable about mountain ranges, grassy plains, rivers, jungles, hunting laws, migratory patterns, and the Bushmen, Masai, Samburu, Dinka and Zulu tribes. He spoke three dialects of Swahili. And he improvised; if there was no firewood, he burned wildebeest dung.\n\nHe was no Gregory Peck, but had an easygoing personality that made for good company in the bush. He coped with emergencies, pulling a client clear of a stampede or a vehicle from a bog, treating snakebites or tracking a wounded lion in a thicket \u2014 his most dangerous game. He was left-handed, but his favorite gun was a right-handed .416 Rigby, which can knock down an onrushing bull elephant or Cape buffalo in a thundering instant.\n\nSafaris changed dramatically in his time. In Kenya and Tanganyika in the late 1940s and \u201950s, he took parties hundreds of miles into trackless bush country by truck, pitched camps with comfortable though primitive amenities, drank gin by kerosene lamp, and pursued game by his own instincts. Safaris lasted two or three months. The showers were often cold, but the food was good and the game plentiful.\n\nIn his later years in Botswana, safaris went out for just a few weeks and focused as much, if not more, on photography as on hunting, although Mr. Selby preferred hunters. Photography buffs stayed in hotel-like lodges and went on day trips to scenic sites. More adventurous hunters and photographers were flown to rendezvous points and driven in Land Rovers to fixed camps elaborately equipped with electric power, refrigerators, flush toilets, hot showers, kitchens and dining facilities with silverware and table linen.\n\n\u201cAfrica itself has changed out of all recognition, both physically and politically, and the old-time self-contained safari would have no place to go in today\u2019s Africa,\u201d Mr. Selby wrote for Sports Afield in 2010, when satellite phones, computers and helicopters made life easy for the busy executive on safari.\n\n\u201cThere are hunters today,\u201d he added, \u201cwho would prefer to have experienced the sense of freedom of an old-time safari, as I am sure there were those who went on safari many years ago who would have preferred something along the lines of what is offered today. The two experiences are as different as night is from day; the only feature common to both is the name \u2026 that magical word, \u2018safari.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohn Henry Selby \u2014 Harry was his universal nickname \u2014 was born in Frankfort, South Africa, on July 22, 1925, the youngest of six children of Arthur and Myrtle Evelyn Randall Selby. When he was 3, his family moved to a 40,000-acre cattle ranch near Mount Kenya.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSurrounded by a game-rich countryside, the boy learned to hunt from an old Kikuyu tribesman. \u201cHe taught me to use my eyes and ears as well as my nose, and to be patient in order to remain motionless for long periods of time waiting for an animal to come within range,\u201d Mr. Selby told The American Rifleman.\n\nMr. Selby attended local schools, traveling by ox cart, and later the Prince of Wales, a boarding school in Nairobi. After World War II, he worked for Mr. Percival, who recognized his potential as a hunter-guide, and in 1949 he joined East Africa\u2019s foremost safari outfitter, Ker & Downey, based in Nairobi. In 1956, after Mr. Ruark\u2019s book had made him famous, he formed his own safari company, Selby & Holmberg.\n\nIn 1953, he married Maria Elizabeth Clulow, known as Miki. They had two children, Mark and Gail. Mark died in 2017. Mr. Selby is survived by his wife, daughter and a number of grandchildren.\n\nIn 1962, after Kenyan independence and political upheavals dimmed prospects for safaris in East Africa, he accepted a partnership in his old company, which became Ker, Downey and Selby, and in 1963 moved as its trailblazer to Bechuanaland, a British protectorate that became independent Botswana in 1966. It was a hunter\u2019s \u2014 and a photographer\u2019s \u2014 paradise.\n\n\u201cWhat we found exceeded our wildest expectations \u2014 a land which the passage of time had passed by, where nature had remained unchanged in the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Selby said in an interview for this obituary. \u201cThe vast savannas were teeming with huge herds of elephant, buffalo, kudu, zebra, wildebeest and sable.

The ad, on the first anniversary of Trump's inauguration, was distributed to reporters in an email from Trump's campaign and purportedly featured scenes from the trial of an undocumented immigrant who was alleged to have killed two police officers in Sacramento.\n\n\u201cIt's pure evil,\u201d a narrator says. \u201cPresident Trump is right: build the wall, deport criminals, stop illegal immigration now. Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants. President Trump will fix our border and keep our families safe.\u201d\n\nTrump nixed a bipartisan Senate proposal that would have provided legal status to immigrants who came to the country illegally as children, known as \u201cdreamers,\u201d in exchange for a $1.6 billion down-payment on his push to build a wall on the southwest border with Mexico. The plan also would have made changes to the nation's legal immigration system.\n\nWithout the immigration deal, the Senate blocked a House bill that would have funded the government for four weeks, leading to the shutdown. A large majority of Democrats voted against the bill, along with a handful of Republicans.\n\nTrump has repeatedly sought to paint immigrants as dangerous, talking about transnational gangs, such as MS-13, and implementing a travel ban on travelers from some countries in the Middle East and Africa over what he said were concerns about terrorism.\n\nBut some studies have shown that immigrants, including those here illegally, commit crimes at lower rates than do native-born Americans.\n\n[Trump\u2019s claim that immigrants bring \u2018tremendous crime\u2019 is wrong]\n\nFor example, a March 2017 study by the pro-immigration Cato Institute found that \u201call immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than natives relative to their shares of the population\u201d and that \u201ceven illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post's Fact Checker reported in 2015, one study showed that between 1990 and 2013, \u201cthe foreign-born share of the U.S. population grew from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent and the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled from 3.5 million to 11.2 million.\n\n\u201cDuring the same period, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48 percent \u2014 which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41 percent, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary,\u201d according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nThe violent crime rate was cut nearly by half during a period in which unauthorized immigrants tripled, according to the council.\n\nSalvador Rizzo contributed to this report.", "title": "In campaign ad, Trump says Democrats \u2018complicit\u2019 in crimes by immigrants", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/20/in-campaign-ad-trump-says-democrats-complicit-in-crimes-by-immigrants/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T23:26:07Z"}, {"textData": "\n\nAt Yellowstone National Park in Montana, George Nell, a maintenance ranger for the National Park Service\u2019s North District, shovels snow from the entrance to the restrooms at the Mammoth campground.

Some national parks were open, but unsupervised. Several iconic parks and monuments were closed, including the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, presidential homes and other historical and cultural sites primarily made up of buildings that can be locked. Even some bathrooms were chained shut.\n\n[Everything you need to know about the government shutdown]\n\nA sign indicates the closure of Independence Hall in Philadelphia on the first day of the federal government shutdown.

The move, part of an effort to reduce the public-facing impact of a shutdown, left many asking themselves if they should enter the parks and risk their lives without the support of park rangers. And it left others upset that their plans to experience American treasures were thwarted.\n\n[Massive confusion spreads through federal bureaucracy ahead of shutdown deadline]\n\n\u201cGood thing I didn\u2019t have my heart set on seeing the Statue of Liberty,\u201d said Catherine Crichlow, 29, of Cincinnati, a web developer who was visiting New York for the first time.

Other national parks \u2014 such as Joshua Tree and Yellowstone \u2014 remained semi-open.\n\n\u201cKeeping parks open with virtually no staff is a risky situation, and the guidance park staff is being given is vague at best,\u201d said Theresa Pierno, the association\u2019s president. \u201cThere is no substitute for National Park Service staff and their expertise, and it is not wise to put the public or our park resources at risk by allowing for half-measures to keep them open.\u201d\n\nThe contradiction of an open park with no supervision left some Joshua Tree campers bewildered.\n\nPaul Norconk woke up looking forward to taking his family to an educational ranger talk about roadrunners.

All visitor centers at the park were closed, and no flag was flying at the campground.\n\nNell said that the Park Service had gone back and forth about who would be deemed essential personnel during the shutdown, and the last he heard, visitor safety was essential.\n\n\u201cIt is all about safety,\u201d Nell said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have people slipping on these sidewalks, or tripping over snowbanks.\u201d\n\nKen Sinay, 64, owner of Yellowstone Safaris, drove by a car that had just run off the icy road in Lamar Valley.

Photography guide Michael Schertz, 57, from the Mount Rainier area of Washington state, said he was serving eight clients this week. He said it was a major risk to have a photography tour scheduled. He had been closely monitoring the votes before the shutdown, as a park closure would have cost him between $10,000 and $15,000.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned because we were bringing in folks that had never been here before,\u201d Schertz said. \u201cWe would have had to refund their money.\u201d\n\nSchertz said that he falls somewhere between being politically independent and Republican, and he does not blame the president for the shutdown. He was upset, however, at the House and Senate because he said he felt that they were not doing their jobs.\n\n\u201cThey are so far removed from having to make a living, and they are not working for us and about doing what is right,\u201d Schertz said. \u201cIt is just a power struggle, and we are caught in the middle.\u201d\n\n\n\nJames Kristy and Ginger Lee, of Palm Beach County, Fla., walk the boardwalk at Yellowstone National Park\u2019s Mammoth Hot Springs in Wyoming.

In 2005, he passed on some of his authority to Boonchai, who operated headquarters in Nakhon Phanom. Contraband was brought from there to Laos through the nearby Mekong River and was transported to Vietnam and China, the Freeland Foundation said.\n\nBoonchai could face up to four years in prison and a fine of 40,000 baht ($1,300), the AP reported.

Markets in the United States and Asia, particularly in China, fueled demand, according to a 2015 international study conducted by National Geographic, and that resulted in the death of about 30,000 elephants every year.\n\nLast spring, China shut down dozens of its licensed ivory facilities, a move that some see as a sign that the country intends to help put an end to the ivory trade.\n\nIn November, the Trump administration announced it will reverse an Obama-era ban on importation of elephant-hunt trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.

In every age group, and at every level of education, about twice as many African American men as women gave Trump positive marks. In all, 23 percent of black men approved of Trump\u2019s performance versus 11 percent of black women . . . Black men are one of the few groups for which Trump\u2019s 2017 average approval rating significantly exceeds his 2016 vote share.\n\nAmong Hispanics, men were also much more likely than women to express positive views about Trump. Among Hispanic men older than 50, Trump\u2019s approval \u2014 strikingly \u2014 exceeded 40 percent.\u201d\n\nConservative commentator Charlie Sykes told the Fix that quite a few men feel as if Trump is speaking for their concerns in a world where few are.\n\n\u201cA lot of blue collar men think they are living in an increasingly feminized world and Donald Trump represents to them unabashed, unapologetic masculinity \u2014 an in-your-face refusal to give in to political correctness or the politics of \u2018sensitivity.\u2019 They think he fights for them, as opposing to judging or preaching at them. And he makes the right enemies \u2014 football players who won\u2019t kneel, black female congresswomen, Hollywood elites, and the media.\n\nThey may not fully embrace his vulgarity, his insults or his brutishness, but they like the attitude. And, increasingly politics is not about issues or policies as much as it is about striking the right attitude.\u201d\n\nAuthor Michael Arceneaux is a frequent Trump critic who often writes about gender. He told the Fix that these numbers aren\u2019t that surprising.\n\n\u201cI regret that men collectively choose to be so embarrassing, but given how ingrained misogyny is in our society, I guess I cannot be totally surprised that a sexist, chauvinistic loudmouth manages to maintain high approval rating amongst men. Despite all signs to the contrary, Trump projects strength because men are trained to believe the sort of bravado and machismo Trump often projects is a sign of strength and leadership. It is, as he would put it, sad!\u201d\n\nBut while Trump may be experiencing some encouraging numbers with men, his team may have to ask themselves if it is worth losing women. Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel recently presented the White House staff with a memo showing how poorly the party is doing with women voters.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that politicians want to appeal to their bases. In the world of politics, there\u2019s a belief that it\u2019s best to dance with the one who brought you as the old saying goes. And it is men who helped get Trump to the White House.\n\nBut in a country that is increasingly looking to its political leaders to be a part of the fight for the respect of women, relying on a voting bloc that jumped on the Trump train in part because of its traditional views of gender could see that train forced to leave Washington.

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) listen as President Trump speaks during a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony on Jan. 17. The latest federal shutdown reveals a deeply polarized political climate. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThough federal shutdowns have become a depressingly familiar ritual of American politics, the current one was born of a newer, more toxic dynamic \u2014 one in which the old partisan arguments about the size and role of government have been supplanted by a tribal battle over what it means to be an American.\n\nThe tactics are the same, and in some ways the culmination of a no-compromise, winner-take-all approach that has been taking root since at least as far back as the rise of the tea party movement. A deeply polarized political climate demands both sides play to their most ideological and rigid partisans.\n\nSo the conditions were there for yet another shutdown. But the match that ignited the kindling was a single comment: President Trump\u2019s racially charged suggestion that \u201cshithole countries\u201d such as Haiti and those from Africa produce undesirable immigrants.\n\nThe remark offered a vivid illustration of how a standoff ostensibly focused on spending had morphed into a different kind of battle. That conflict now pits the nativist impulses unleashed by Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and now embraced by his party at large, against the demands of a Democratic base that more reflects and embraces an increasingly diverse nation.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake in the immigration fight is a clash between two visions of our future \u2014 or if you want to be literal about it, a clash between our future and our past,\u201d said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Clinton Administration. \u201cBoth sides have pushed a large pile of chips on the table.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have insisted their leaders dig in on extending an Obama-era program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), offering protection against deportation to an estimated 800,000 immigrants brought to this country illegally as young children. The president demanded funding for his proposed border wall and other security measures.\n\nThe political ramifications are not entirely obvious, notwithstanding the hashtag war branding the impasse either the #schumershutdown, laying responsibility on Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), or the #trumpshutdown.\n\nWho gets the blame \u2014 or if voters will even care about the shutdown by the time Election Day rolls around \u2014 remains to be seen. Much will depend on how long it lasts and whether it damages the economy.\n\nWhile polls show large majorities are sympathetic to the plight of the young undocumented immigrants, most also say keeping the government open is a higher priority. The wall, on the other hand, is largely unpopular outside Trump\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost certainly a partisan filter for how people perceive this,\u201d said Steven Law, who heads the Senate Leadership Fund, a well-funded super PAC tied to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u201cAt worst, from my perspective, it will end up being a wash. This won\u2019t be like past shutdowns.\u201d\n\nShutdowns for a generation have been fought around the traditional partisan divides over federal spending and the government\u2019s role in American life. Most notable among them have been the ones in 1995 and 1996, and in 2013.\n\nThe balance of power was very different in those years. Both of the earlier shutdowns came at a time of divided government, with Democrats controlling the White House, and Republicans running Congress. And both turned out poorly for the Republicans.\n\nThe current deadlock is happening as \u2014 and because \u2014 the two parties are in the process of reorienting themselves in ways their top strategists once warned against.\n\nThat in turn reflects the shifting attitudes among their voters. When the Pew Research Center asked Americans in 1994 if \u201cimmigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents\u201d there was almost no partisan difference in the responses \u2014 32 percent of Democratic-leaning voters and 30 percent of Republican-leaning voters answered yes.\n\nBut that same question reveals an enormous political divide. In the summer of 2017, 84 percent on the Democratic side agreed that immigrants were a strength, compared with 42 percent on the Republican side \u2014 a gap of 42 points.\n\nAs recently as a decade ago, Democrats were leery of looking too permissive on immigration, and anxious to avoid election-year attacks over giving government benefits to the undocumented.\n\nThe Democratic stance on immigration is now defined from the increasingly impatient left. Protesters who support a path to citizenship have in recent years made their mark by disrupting events by leaders like President Barack Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cIt is a remarkable shift to see Democrats are leaning into the issue,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the leader of America\u2019s Voice, a liberal organization that supports a path to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThe Democratic Party is seeing people of color as full and equal parts of the coalition rather than communities that are more important come election time and less important when it comes to legislation.\u201d\n\nConservative activists have also been cheered by the dramatic shift in Republican focus, which has followed the White House\u2019s embrace of nativist language that casts the standoff as a choice between government funding for \u201clawful citizens\u201d and the \u201creckless demands\u201d of \u201cunlawful immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven two or three years ago, you couldn\u2019t have gotten away with being hard line on immigration,\u201d said Ed Martin, a former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party who now runs Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, a group that advocates for immigration restrictions. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the position that was palatable to the Republican donor class and the establishment.\u201d\n\nBut Trump proved in the 2016 election that immigration unified the GOP much more effectively than did its traditional focus on reducing entitlement spending, free trade and low deficits. Among the GOP base, the populist issues of trade and immigration are now far more animating than even abortion or taxes, Martin said.\n\n\u201cFor the Republicans that\u2019s helpful, because I have never thought that the populist movement would be able to understand the tax cuts as well as immigration,\u201d he said.\n\nRick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, agrees that immigration has become a front-burner question for the Republican base, and will likely prove decisive in GOP turnout this November.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump signs a DACA deal, caves on this thing, on the one-year anniversary of his presidency, it ends his presidency for all intents and purposes,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThere is no reason for the blue collar Democrats who voted for Trump last time to come out again.\u201d\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who led his party into the 1995 and 1996 shutdown over government spending, says Republicans have set up this confrontation as a midterm winner. The GOP will cast the Democrats as more focused on identity politics than the national interests, like funding the military, Gingrich predicted.\n\n\u201cThis is a decision by the Democrats that their future absolutely requires them to polarize the Latino vote,\u201d he added.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are betting it will be the Republicans who find themselves estranged and isolated.\n\n\u201cThey are living through a Trumpian period of ethnic nationalism and populism,\u201d Sharry said. \u201cThat clearly works for a majority of their party. But the majority of the country is much more in line with where the Democrats are.\u201d\n\nmichael.scherer@washpost.com", "title": "Shutdown: A familiar partisan ritual takes on new meaning in the Trump era - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/shutdown-a-familiar-partisan-ritual-takes-on-new-meaning-in-the-trump-era/2018/01/20/d9952b12-fdf8-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T22:54:36Z"}, {"textData": "Photo\n\nCAIRO \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence and the Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi pledged a united front against terrorism in the Middle East as Mr. Pence, the highest-level American official to visit the United States ally in nearly a decade, began a trip through the region after leaving behind a government shutdown in Washington.\n\nThe meetings focused on security cooperation and economic ties between the two countries as well as efforts to fight the Islamic State.

Graham (R-S.C.) seems to agree, suggesting at one point that senior policy adviser Stephen Miller was yanking the president around last week. \u201cThe Stephen Miller approach to immigration has no viability. Tuesday, the president was in a good place. He was the president of all of us,\u201d Graham told MSNBC on Friday. \u201cHe spoke compassionately about immigration, tough on security, wanted bipartisanship. Two days later, there was a major change.\u201d He continued, \u201cI think the change comes about from people like Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller is well known in the Senate for having views that are outside the mainstream.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has also been frustrated at times. On Wednesday, he grumbled, \u201cI\u2019m looking for something that President Trump supports, and he has not yet indicated what measure he is willing to sign. As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels.\u201d We really have no idea what that might be, even after the government has shuttered.\n\nThe White House declared on Saturday that Trump would not talk about immigration before the shutdown \u2014 as far as one could get from his position that he\u2019d sign any deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 but McConnell took a different approach. He announced Saturday, \u201cLet\u2019s resume the bipartisan discussion on funding, our troops, DACA, on government spending and all of the other priorities that all of us can work together to resolve.\u201d But wait \u2014 didn\u2019t the White House say Trump wouldn\u2019t talk about DACA now?\n\nThis is what comes from electing and covering for a president who has little grasp of the details and seems not to comprehend when his statements contradict his earlier statements. He\u2019s either so confused or so forgetful that as soon as one set of the parties leave the room, he can be spun around by whomever he sees next. This is not flexibility or negotiating prowess; it is a recipe for chaos and a shutdown.\n\nRather than blame Democrats, who they know have been bamboozled just as they have been many times, McConnell and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) might consider assuming the roles of leaders of a co-equal branch of government. They might embrace their position as leaders not merely of their party but of their legislative bodies. There is a large majority for a deal that includes border security, a DACA fix, extension of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and increased defense spending. Put it on the floor and let it pass \u2014 by a wide margin. Send it to the president, who said he\u2019d sign whatever was agreed to. In other words, ignore the president and his novice staff who are incapable of closing a deal. Instead, hand them one passed by both parties. Then Trump can go to Mar-a-Lago or Davos or wherever and claim he made the deal, though he\u2019d be unable to explain what is in it.\n\nRepublicans thought they could support Trump and get him to sign whatever they sent him. In the real world, when you need both parties to reach agreement and the president has no bottom line, you have a complete breakdown in governance. When the president is surrounded by a cadre of advisers whose policies sound straight out of the white nationalist handbook you may face a very long shutdown.", "title": "Shutdown agreement!

A blatant falsehood from the White House podium.\n\nAnd that was just the first 24 hours.\n\nIn his first year in office, Donald Trump proved to be a singular figure, casting aside norms and traditions, fighting with Republicans and Democrats alike and changing how the nation and the presidency are viewed at home and abroad.\n\nSeemingly each day spawned several can-you-believe-it headlines that would have defined a previous president\u2019s term. But in the hyper-accelerated Trump news cycle, many were forgotten by the next morning.\n\nAppropriate for a former reality TV star, Trump\u2019s first year was can\u2019t-miss drama, full of unforgettable characters, surprise casting changes and innumerable plot twists. It came against the backdrop of a deeply polarized nation, a looming nuclear threat, whispers about the president\u2019s fitness for office and, for good measure, the shadow of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe reviews weren\u2019t kind. Trump\u2019s first-year approval rating stood at 39 percent, the lowest of any president. But viewers couldn\u2019t look away.\n\n\u201cHe is a compulsively watchable political character,\u201d said Jon Meacham, presidential historian and biographer. \u201cThe country elected the most unconventional president in our history and he has proven to be just that. To me, the story of the first year is the atmospheric chaos that the president has created, sustained and perpetuated.\u201d\n\nTrump was the first president to be elected without any government or military experience. And from the first moments of Trump\u2019s inauguration, it was clear that Washington had never seen anything like this before.\n\nHis inaugural speech was a dark pitch to the nation\u2019s forgotten, suggesting a retreat from the world under the slogan of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d It soon led to an uproar over the White House press secretary\u2019s wild claims about the inauguration crowd size.\n\nSoon, other crowds were the story.\n\nMillions of people flooded streets around the globe for the \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d to protest Trump\u2019s presidency. That set the template for the so-called #Resistance, which swarmed airports just days later when the White House suddenly announced its travel ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThere would be little attempt from Trump to bring those protesters into the fold. Despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, the president forged forward as if elected with a sweeping mandate, aiming his policies directly at his base \u2014 with moves such as the rollback of environment regulations and civil rights protections \u2014 and blaming Democrats for any Washington failure.\n\nAlways eager to have a foe, Trump governed as he campaigned, and not just by incessantly reliving his 2016 election over Hillary Clinton. Trump frequently instigated fights and rarely let a slight go unanswered via his favorite weapon, his Twitter account.\n\nAny pre-inauguration talk of restraining his Twitter usage was soon forgotten. He used the 140-character \u2014 and later, up to 280 \u2014 bursts to target foes, traffic in conspiracy theories, salute the programming on Fox News, rattle Congress and unnerve world capitals. In March, he even made the unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor had wiretapped Trump Tower, and he labeled President Barack Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy.\u201d\n\nThe trail of tweets has roiled the capital for 12 months. Across Washington, phones would buzz with alerts anytime Trump tweeted. Republicans found themselves to be targets of Trump\u2019s tweet just like Democrats, particularly when their efforts to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 a plan seven years in the making \u2014 failed not once, but twice.\n\nSome tweets drew puzzlement; none more than the president\u2019s late-night posting of the nonsensical word \u201ccovfefe.\u201d\n\nSome tweets challenged American institutions, full of criticisms of the media and the FBI. Others provoked outrage, as when he suggested that MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski had a face-lift or claimed that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., \u201cwould do anything\u201d for a donation, an unsavory insinuation made at the height of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe discussion about sexual harassment toppled many powerful men but, while Trump\u2019s own accusers resurfaced, the White House never changed its story: The women were lying.\n\nThat was just one of many moments in which Trump appeared almost eager to foment divisions, including racial ones.\n\nHis political career was launched on the lie that Obama was not born in the United States, and this month, Trump was denounced for dismissing African nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d when he urged a limit on immigration from that continent.\n\nHe dismissed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d mocking her claims about being part Native American, while addressing a group of American Indians. More divisively, he blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence between neo-Nazis and anti-hate group protesters that left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nWhile Trump was rewriting the rules of behavior within the Oval Office, his agenda was largely lifted from the Republican playbook and his first year victories thrilled the GOP orthodoxy. He appointed conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, rolled back business regulations, presided over a massive tax cut and, the White House argued, fostered an environment that freed the stock market to boom.\n\n\u201c2017 was a year of tremendous achievement (and) the achievements for our country, our people, and for our standing in the world have been very monumental,\u201d Trump said at a Cabinet meeting last week, before offering a glimpse into how he views the presidency \u2014 as catnip for cable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure their ratings were fantastic. They always are,\u201d he said.\n\nLike any president, Trump faced crises during his first year.\n\nMost ominously, North Korea escalated its nuclear weapons development program while Trump responded with unprecedentedly bellicose rhetoric. He warned of \u201cfire and fury\u201d that could wipe out Pyongyang. At the United Nations, he insulted North Korean leader Kim Jung Un as \u201cLittle Rocket Man.\u201d Trump took to Twitter to suggest that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim\u2019s.\n\nThe anniversary of his inauguration coincided with a government shutdown, and he scoffed that Democrats \u201cwanted to give me a nice present.\u201d\n\nHe traveled overseas four times, upbraiding traditional American allies at NATO for not paying enough, basking in the flattery of Chinese President Xi Jinping and touching a mysterious, glowing orb with Saudi King Salman.\n\nHis responses to domestic tragedies were uneven.\n\nHe paid tribute to the 58 victims of a shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas, but made no effort to toughen gun control laws. When Hurricane Maria crushed Puerto Rico, leaving half the island without power for months, Trump feuded with a local mayor and, during a visit, distributed paper towels to survivors by shooting them like they were basketballs.\n\nBefitting a man whose reality show ended with a firing each week, in Trump\u2019s first year his administration\u2019s upper-level officials have had a turnover rate of 34 percent, much higher than any other in the past 40 years. Gone were chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer and, after just 11 eventful days, communications director Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nBut the circumstances of two exits above all may define not just Trump\u2019s first year in office, but those to follow.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Flynn was fired less than a month into the term for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with foreign officials. In May, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\nThat dismissal led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose probe into possible collusion and obstruction of justice has hovered over the White House. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and is now cooperating with Mueller. Trump himself may at some point be interviewed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a president who had such a chaotic first year. Every day is topsy-turvy and disorganized, the country has not been so divided since the Civil War and Trump thrives at being the bull that carries his own china shop around with him,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cHe\u2019s not like anything we\u2019ve seen before and this is the question: What are the consequences going to be?\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s First Year in Office Has Been a Can\u2019t-Miss Drama", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5111502/donald-trump-first-year-in-office/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T22:00:21Z"}, {"textData": "\u201cEvery Grand Slam that I\u2019ve won, I\u2019ve had a different service motion,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably had like four or five since the surgery.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDjokovic\u2019s new, abbreviated motion is also linked to injury, though he insists he has not had surgery. While he has yet to disclose the precise nature of the ailment, he has a right elbow problem, and it forced him to take his first extended absence from the game.\n\nHe is still wearing a compression sleeve during his matches, and is now into the fourth round at the Australian Open, his first tournament since Wimbledon last July. On Saturday, Djokovic, a longtime No. 1 now seeded 14th, defeated Albert Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas, the No. 21 seed from Spain, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3.\n\nAt one point on Saturday, the elbow seemed the least of his problems. He took a medical timeout in the second set and lay on the court to have his back and legs massaged and treated at Margaret Court Arena.\n\nBut he soon rose and resumed his dominating play. He did not lose his serve once in the match, which was played in much milder conditions than his steamy four-set victory over Ga\u00ebl Monfils on Thursday, when recorded temperatures on court peaked at 69 degrees Celsius (156 Fahrenheit).\n\nAsked about the on-court treatment, Djokovic answered without being specific: \u201cI\u2019ve never faced a situation where I didn\u2019t compete six months. I mean that\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of forced to be very cautious of what happens day to day, be dedicated to my body and training. It\u2019s nothing major to be concerned about. It\u2019s just things that surface every day. I guess it\u2019s normal. A lot of athletes are facing these kind of levels and stages of pain throughout their body in big competitions, and they deal with it. I deal with it. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenges for his elbow and serve lie ahead. In the fourth round on Monday, he will face Hyeon Chung, an unseeded but dangerous South Korean. Chung, 21, beat the leader of his tennis peer group, Alexander Zverev, in five sets on Saturday.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf Djokovic beats Chung, he is likely to face fifth-seeded Dominic Thiem, who plays the unseeded American Tennys Sandgren in the fourth round.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cInto the second week, it\u2019s going to be a game of small margins, so let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d said Djokovic, who pronounced himself \u201cpleased with where my game is at the moment.\u201d\n\nMany elite tennis players in their prime have tinkered with their service technique, be it their stance or motion. In an attempt to get more power, Rafael Nadal changed his grip on his serve in 2010 when he already was No. 1 in the world. Pat Cash changed his motion significantly after winning Wimbledon in 1987.\n\nBut some players have made more radical changes on other strokes. Consider Paul McNamee, the former Australian star who changed from a single-handed to a double-handed backhand at age 24 because he believed the stroke was holding him back.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely hard,\u201d McNamee said recently of the change. \u201cEight to 10 hours a day for four months. I made a pact with myself that I would never go back to a one-hander. It was very embarrassing to begin with.\u201d\n\nAfter the change, McNamee soon broke into the top 25 in singles and reached No. 1 in doubles.\n\n\u201cThe key was the pact,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, I would have retreated back to the familiar quickly. The mental commitment for me was more difficult than the physical, and harder to sustain.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOther established pros have switched from two-handed backhands to one-handed ones, including Fernando Meligeni, the former Brazilian star, and Tatjana Maria, the German who lost to Sharapova here in the first round.\n\nJill Craybas, the 1996 N.C.A.A. singles women\u2019s champion at Florida, salvaged her faltering pro career in the early 2000s by changing her forehand grip and switching from a closed-stance to an open-stance forehand. She upset Serena Williams in the third round of Wimbledon in 2005 and remained on tour until 2013.\n\n\u201cI remember matches where the racket felt like a foreign object in my hand,\u201d she said of the changes in an interview at Melbourne Park on Saturday. \u201cIt took me at least a year to lock it in. Djokovic is a little bit different because it\u2019s not a grip change, more of a motion change, and he\u2019s doing it more to protect the injury whereas I was doing it more to progress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDjokovic\u2019s serve is significantly different: He no longer drops his racket head low at the start of the motion, which is now more compact. He has said the change, designed to protect his elbow, was the product of discussions with his coaches Andre Agassi and Radek Stepanek and his own input.\n\n\u201cIt had to come from Novak,\u201d McNamee said. \u201cIf not, it is doomed, as he has to own it absolutely or he will revert after a bad loss.\u201d\n\nFor now, he is 3-0 with the new serve and hitting first-serve speeds similar, on average, to what he hit in 2016, when he last won this title.

She remembered him constantly looking out the windows overlooking an area where the concert would be held the next month. He moved from window to window to see the site from different angles, the report said.\n\nPaddock had become \u201cdistant\u201d in the year before the shooting and their relationship was no longer intimate, Danley said during an interview with investigators. She described him as germophobic and said he had strong reactions to smells.\n\nPaddock, who fatally shot himself in his hotel room, had told friends and relatives that he always felt ill, in pain and fatigued.\n\nHis doctor thought he may have had bipolar disorder but told police that Paddock refused to discuss the possibility, the report said. The doctor offered him antidepressants, but Paddock accepted only a prescription for anxiety medication. Paddock was fearful of medication and often refused to take it, the doctor told investigators.\n\nThe 64-year-old retired accountant and real estate investor had lost a \u201csignificant amount of wealth\u201d since September 2015, which led to \u201cbouts of depression,\u201d the sheriff has said. Paddock had paid off his gambling debts before the shooting, according to the report.\n\nDanley was in the Philippines at the time of the shooting. In the days before the attack, Paddock sent her a $100,000 wire transfer. She has said she found that odd and thought he might have been breaking up with her when he sent her the money and told her to use it to buy a home for her family there.\n\nDuring an interview with the FBI after she returned from the Philippines, Danley volunteered that investigators would find her fingerprints on bullets used during the attack because she would sometimes help Paddock load high-volume ammunition magazines, according to FBI warrant documents.\n\nInvestigators found 23 rifles and a handgun in his hotel suite and more than a dozen of the rifles were fitted with \u201cbump stock\u201d devices that allowed rapid-fire shooting similar to fully automatic weapons. Dozens of guns were strewn around the room, some left inside a bassinet.\n\nIn their report, police released never-before-seen photos from inside the hotel suite, including one shot through a broken window, showing the concert venue still littered with personal belongings left when thousands ran to escape the hail of bullets raining from above.\n\nPaddock fired more than 1,100 bullets, mostly from two windows on the 32nd floor of the hotel, into a crowd of 22,000 people attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival music below, Lombardo has said. That includes about 200 shots fired through his hotel room door into a hallway where an unarmed hotel security guard was wounded in the leg and a maintenance engineer took cover.\n\nPrior to the attack, Paddock had researched SWAT tactics and searched online for other potential public targets, including in Chicago, Boston and Santa Monica, California, the sheriff said. His research also sought the number of attendees at other concerts in Las Vegas and the size of the crowds at Santa Monica\u2019s beach. Among his searches was \u201cdo police use explosives,\u201d the report said.\n\nFour laptops and three cellphones were found inside his hotel suite. On one of the computers, investigators found hundreds of photos of child pornography. The same computer was used to search for the height of the Mandalay Bay, how to remove hard drives from laptops, the location of gun shows in Nevada and information about several other Las Vegas casinos.\n\nA federal grand jury is hearing evidence in a case that spun off from the shooting investigation, the sheriff said. The FBI has \u201can ongoing case against an individual of federal interest,\u201d Lombardo said, declining to elaborate.\n\nSpokeswomen for the FBI and federal prosecutors in Las Vegas declined to comment.", "title": "Las Vegas Shooter Was Germophobe and Possibly Bipolar, Records Show", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5111481/las-vegas-shooter-bipolar/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:53:10Z"}, {"textData": "Volunteer lawyers helped delay the villagers\u2019 eviction in the courts even as the police intensified their campaign on the ground. Starting last March, the police began coming nearly every day to harass the residents.\n\nOne reason the 146 families who lived in Mazowe felt betrayed by their leader was that they themselves had seized the land from a white farmer in 2000, under Mr. Mugabe\u2019s fast-track land reform program. Now, they risked losing everything to his wife and daughter: 3,100 acres of prime land for farming and cattle ranching that abuts a lake and gold mines.\n\nAs Zimbabwe embarks on its post-Mugabe era, the unresolved issue of land ownership remains at the heart of the nation\u2019s future, just as it was at the time of independence, in 1980.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the talks leading to independence from white-minority rule, Mr. Mugabe was pressured into an agreement that left land ownership unsettled. In what was and remains an agricultural economy, the nation\u2019s most productive farmland was in the hands of a few thousand white settlers.\n\nResolving the land issue, including compensating white farmers whose properties were later seized, is critical to repairing relations with Western nations and international lenders, which have been virtually frozen for nearly a generation. The new government desperately needs Western assistance to revive the nation\u2019s moribund economy.\n\nDetermining who owns the land is a necessary step to development and democratization in Zimbabwe. Nearly all Zimbabweans who benefited from Mr. Mugabe\u2019s land reform policy lack titles, or legal ownership of their property \u2014 leaving them at the mercy of the politically powerful.\n\nIn his inauguration speech, President Emmerson Mnangagwa \u2014 who, with his military allies, removed Mr. Mugabe, 93, from power \u2014 said that \u201crepossessing our land cannot be challenged or reversed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Mnangagwa said that he was \u201ccommitted to compensating those farmers from whom land was taken.\u201d In addition, he said that \u201ccomplex issues of land tenure will have to be addressed\u201d so as \u201cto ensure finality and closure to the ownership and management of this key resource.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials highlighted the case of a white Zimbabwean, Rob Smart, who was allowed to return to his farm in December. But Mr. Smart had lost his farm only six months earlier amid factional fighting inside the ruling party and regained it after Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s side emerged victorious, not through any policy change.\n\nSo far, the government has yet to take any concrete steps toward compensation or even to meet with representatives of the thousands of former landowners, said Ben Freeth, a leader of white Zimbabweans whose farms were seized.\n\nMr. Mnangagwa was indicating his support for the tentative steps taken by the Zimbabwean government in the past few years. In order to qualify for badly needed loans from international creditors like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, government officials had begun mapping the 6,000 farms that were seized after the fast-track program started in the late 1990s. The government even held workshops on the compensation of white farmers.\n\nPhoto\n\nGovernment and Western officials, however, had remained skeptical that any final decision could be taken as long as Mr. Mugabe held power.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Mr. Mnangagwa will follow through on his recent promises. As Mr. Mugabe\u2019s longtime right-hand man, the new president is believed to have overseen the former leader\u2019s often violent land policy.\n\nLand also remains a tool of political control, one that Mr. Mnangagwa and other leaders of the governing ZANU-PF party have never shown a willingness to relinquish.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric was encouraging, but we wait to see the practice,\u201d Moses Donsa Nkomo, a lawyer with Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, who represented the villagers in Mazowe, said of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s pledge. \u201cI\u2019m a bit skeptical. That is the system that has kept them in power until now.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, as fighting over succession intensified inside ZANU-PF, land was used to punish and to keep people in line.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHigh-ranking officials expelled from the party had their land seized, or suffered repeated incursions into their properties by party youths. The threat of losing their farms led some officials to stay in ZANU-PF, instead of decamping to new opposition parties.\n\n\u201cThe land reform program was correct, but it was not implemented correctly,\u201d said Temba P. Mliswa, who was expelled from ZANU-PF in 2014 and is now an independent lawmaker.\n\nMr. Mliswa \u2014 who managed to keep his 2,000-acre farm despite party youths who invaded and destroyed his property \u2014 said the ruling party uses land to \u201ccontrol you.\u201d In addition, he and many other critics have pointed out that many senior politicians and the politically connected have more than one farm, in violation of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s land policy.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince Mr. Mugabe\u2019s fall from power, the raids in Mazowe have ceased, and the police no longer bar visitors from the single dirt road that leads to the property, which locals still call by its colonial name, Arnolds Farm.\n\nBut the destruction brought by the police officers \u2014 who variously told the villagers that Mrs. Mugabe and her daughter wanted to build a university named after the president on the land and to erect a memorial to him \u2014 is still visible.\n\nThe police tore down two mud-brick homes belonging to Angeline Zvirikunzeno and her adult daughter, Rutendo Maluleke.\n\nStanding next to a pile of bricks covered by a roof of corrugated zinc, they said they had slept in the open air as they rebuilt one house \u2014 using straw and branches.\n\n\u201cIt took us two months to rebuild because the police kept harassing us,\u201d Ms. Maluleke said.\n\nSome villagers were relieved that the threat from the Mugabes appeared to have passed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent happy,\u201d said Susan Madoka, who lost two small homes to the police this year.\n\nVillage leaders, however, were more cautious about the future.\n\nSince seizing Arnolds Farm in 2000, the village\u2019s families have lived as subsistence farmers. Like other Zimbabweans who were given access to land, they did not get the titles necessary to guarantee bank loans. Without these loans, they cannot buy the equipment needed to extricate themselves from subsistence farming \u2014 and their dependence on the party that has ruled Zimbabwe since independence.\n\nMr. Chaparadza, the village leader, said that as part of any resolution of the land issue, the new government should compensate white farmers.\n\n\u201cEven if they come back, that\u2019s fine as long as they give us another place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t deny them.

(Photo: Kena Betancur, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nEditor's Note: This column originally appeared in April when Congress managed to avoid a government shutdown by passing a compromise spending plan..\n\nEvery time President Trump changes his mind about a fundamental position in a matter of minutes because somebody said something to him, somewhere out there a few negotiators do not get their wings. They get hives and a migraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent dizzying reversal on the North American Free Trade Agreement reportedly came about when two Cabinet secretaries showed him a map of who'd be hurt if he killed the pact with Canada and Mexico: his own voters. But you would not be safe in assuming Trump will change his mind if he learns something will hurt his voters. If that were the case, he\u2019d be trying to save Obamacare instead of destroy it. There is plenty of evidence and even a map that show the House Republican health plan would hit hardest by far in the states he carried.\n\nMaybe Trump\u2019s position depends on the views of the relevant Cabinet member (Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is a fierce opponent of Obamacare). Or which way the wind is blowing among Republicans in Congress (they like NAFTA, and they ran on repealing Obamacare). Maybe the key is what a foreign leader says. Fundamental flips have been known to happen following such tutorials \u2014 that is, conversations.\n\nThe only constants with Trump are unpredictability and expediency. These are not, suffice it to say, the traditional cornerstones of getting to yes in politics. The real pillars are trust and discretion. Can you rely on your negotiating partner to be consistent, to not leak or tweet or make counterproductive headlines, to be truly interested in a win-win outcome and understand what that will take?\n\nThis is how political compromises are achieved, as I reported in my book, The Art of the Political Deal. The Trump White House, however, is a gush of leaks. Trump himself is obsessed with winners, losers and public relations. It\u2019s unclear from day to day where he stands on issues, whether he is familiar with them and whether he even cares. This has turned off Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nNor do Trump\u2019s explanations increase confidence in his reliability as a negotiating partner. He didn\u2019t realize health care was so complicated until he became president. He also apparently didn\u2019t realize that he\u2019d need China\u2019s help with North Korea, that NATO might be useful, that NAFTA was actually doing some good, and that Mexico could not be bullied into paying for a border wall. Thus NATO is no longer obsolete. China is not going to be branded a currency manipulator. And that border wall could turn into fencing, technology and manpower financed by U.S. taxpayers.\n\nThe obvious solution to Trump\u2019s compulsive disruption would be to cut him out of the negotiating loop \u2014 let some experienced hands and Congress take care of things. But there\u2019s no way to do that. This president enjoys hurling curve balls and wrenches, whether it\u2019s threatening to move on from health care if the House couldn\u2019t pass a bill (that lasted less than a month) or tweeting provocatively about Puerto Rico\u2019s problems paying for Medicaid (an issue congressional negotiators were discussing as they worked last week to avoid a government shutdown).\n\nIf Trump suddenly demands a tax plan to beat the 100-day clock, as happened last week, drop everything \u2014 health care, funding the government, the complicated planning for the real tax push \u2014 and start scribbling on that napkin. One can only hope he doesn\u2019t suddenly demand an immediate attack on North Korea. Napkin time.\n\nSuccessful negotiators of the past did not have to deal with public presidential ultimatums and social media outbursts. For instance, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray negotiated a major budget deal in 2013 when they chaired their respective Budget committees. They got to know each other over several months, and nothing they said to each other in confidence ended up in the news. They knew it was important that both could claim some wins. And what constituted a win didn\u2019t change. Ryan and his party had longstanding positions, as did Murray, President Obama and their party. Some things were simply non-negotiable; others had wiggle room. These were familiar to both sides, and they stayed constant.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAnother success was a 2014 public lands package that included scores of development and conservation projects and left out scores of others. Leaks and indecision would have blown it up. But House and Senate negotiators, a sprawling cast from both parties, did not go wobbly or public. They all certainly had plenty to complain about. An acre for a cemetery to expand that was counted on the development side of the ledger? A permanent end to eminent domain as a tool to protect parks, rivers and wilderness? And yet no one was out there on Twitter bemoaning the horror of it all. They kept everything quiet until they had a final product. Their trust in one another had not been misplaced.\n\nFragmentation in Washington, between Republicans and Democrats but also among Republicans themselves, means we're in for months of intensive negotiation to get anything done. This week, Trump and lawmakers need a deal to keep the government open and funded until Oct. 1. By fall, Congress will have to raise the debt ceiling to keep America solvent. Deals will be necessary to move forward on health care, tax reform, infrastructure spending and Trump's enormously contentious budget proposal.\n\nBut no amount of talking will get anyone anywhere if members of Congress can\u2019t trust Trump to stick to a position, forgo revenge and threats, and demonstrate convincingly that he\u2019s interested in more than his own polling, branding and wealth. Trump said he alone could fix Washington. At the moment, there's a real case that he alone is breaking it.\n\nJill Lawrence is the commentary editor of USA TODAY and author of The Art of the Political Deal: How Congress Beat the Odds and Broke Through Gridlock.

The laws regulate the domestic ivory market and criminalize the sale of African elephant ivory. But rhinoceros horns, pangolin scales, turtles, and other exotic wildlife are still repeatedly smuggled through Thailand.\n\nIn December, a Thai airport official, Nikorn Wongprajan, was arrested at Suvarnabhumi Airport after he was caught \u2014 along with a Chinese smuggler and a Vietnamese courier \u2014 with 14 rhino horns and admitted to being hired to send the horns to one of Mr. Boonchai\u2019s relatives, Freeland\u2019s statement said. The group helped Thai police with information about Mr. Boonchai that led to his arrest.\n\nSteve Galster, founder of Freeland, said Boonchai\u2019s arrest is Thailand\u2019s \u201clargest wildlife crime case ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis network is connected to a group of moneymen who may be living outside the country. We are working to get arrest warrants out on those people as well,\u201d said Gen. Chalermkiat Sriworakhan, the deputy national police commissioner.\n\nThree years ago, Thailand froze $37 million in assets linked to a tiger trafficking ring in the country\u2019s northeast, after an investigation helped by Freeland. In 2016, a court order seized Thai bank accounts and other assets, including a house worth $142,000, belonging to Chumlong Lemtongthai, a Thai who was convicted in South Africa on rhino horn trafficking charges.\n\nMr. Chumlung was imprisoned in 2012 after being sent by the Southeast Asian trafficking syndicate called the Xaysavang network \u2014 which authorities say includes Mr. Boonchai \u2014 to take advantage of South Africa\u2019s permit system for professional trophy hunts. He hired prostitutes to pose as hunters, and organized sham expeditions in which 26 rhinos were killed, according to court documents. Customs papers were then doctored for shipping the rhino horns to Laos.\n\n\u201cWe have been looking at this syndicate for over a decade now,\u201d said Onkuri Majumdar, a program officer from Freeland. \u201cThey have tentacles all over Africa and Southeast Asia.

Iranians have a term for the growing class of victims: \u201cproperty losers,\u201d or \u201cmal-baakhtegan\u201d in Persian.\n\nMany of the failing institutions sank the money into speculative investments during a real estate bubble, lent to well-connected friends or charged usurious interest rates to desperate borrowers. Now, regulators have quietly steered many of the companies into mergers with larger banks to try to absorb their losses, but that has created a worsening problem of bad loans and overvalued assets throughout the banking system.\n\nEconomists say that as many as 40 percent of the loans carried on the books of Iranian banks may be delinquent.\n\n\u201cThe whole financial system in Iran is in a very fragile state,\u201d said Borghan N.

In December, a lawmaker, Mahmoud Sadeghi, released a document listing the Top 20 debtors who had failed to meet payment deadlines for Sarmayeh Bank, which is co-owned by a pension fund for teachers. The loans totaled $1.9 billion, and almost all appeared to be held by well-known insiders.\n\nAmong them was Hossein Hedayati, a business tycoon and former member of the Revolutionary Guards, whose swift rise was so conspicuous that websites speculated about the sources of his sudden wealth. The document released by the lawmaker showed that Mr. Hedayati owed $285 million, and in a television program discussing the loan, another lawmaker, Mohammad Hassannejad, accused Mr. Hedayati of using a series of front companies to swing the loans and hide his role.\n\nMr. Hedayati dialed in to the program, sputtering with rage; he denied borrowing from Sarmayeh and threated to \u201csue everyone,\u201d but has yet to follow through on the threat.\n\nAfter the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the new Islamic Republic initially nationalized all banks, among other industries. It also created a variety of semiofficial holding companies controlled by the supreme leader, senior clerics or top military commanders. Over the years, many of the companies have evolved into sprawling conglomerates with major roles in even the ostensibly private economy.\n\nClerics controlled religious foundations, called bonyads, that acquired commercial businesses. The largest of these, under the supreme leader, now makes up \u201c15 to 20 percent\u201d of the Iranian economy, according to an estimate by Hooshang Amirahmadi, an economist at Rutgers University who studies Iran. The elite Revolutionary Guard Corps controls a separate business empire.\n\nAll the semiofficial holding companies have major advantages over private businesses in favorable access to capital, tax exemptions and political connections. And most or all of them have been plagued by accusations of inefficiency and mismanagement, in addition to insider dealing and other forms of corruption.\n\nGovernment reformers took steps to open up the banking business in the late 1990s and early 2000s, first by allowing religious foundations to set up loosely regulated savings and loans, ostensibly to serve the poor. The opening of private banks or the sale of shares in state banks soon followed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut under a conservative president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who came to power in 2005, semiofficial bodies controlled by clerics, the Revolutionary Guards or their allies dominated the newly private financial sector. An internal study produced in 2013 showed that semiofficial state bodies owned seven of the 17 private banks. Among them, the Revolutionary Guards controlled at least two, while the army, the police, the municipality of Tehran and a giant religious foundation close to the Guards controlled the others.\n\nAmong those financial institutions not directly controlled by these semiofficial bodies, the largest were usually run by individuals close to the same ruling elite, economists and diplomats say. They say that made it almost impossible for even the best-intentioned regulators to police the banks.\n\n\u201cThe involvement of opaque government institutions like the Revolutionary Guards works contrary to transparency, and the lack of transparency is a recipe for poor banking practices,\u201d said Sir Simon Gass, who was the British ambassador to Tehran from 2009 to 2011, in a recent interview. \u201cThe Central Bank of Iran tries to inject discipline into the system but with limited success.\u201d\n\nThe outsize returns promised by the banks and financial institutions lured capital that might better have gone to more productive uses, contributing to an economic downturn brought on, in part, by international sanctions imposed because of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Economists say that helps explain why most sectors of the Iranian economy outside the oil industry have yet to reap the benefits of the sanctions\u2019 repeal after the nuclear deal with the West.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen lenders began to fail over the past few years, some senior Iranian officials tried to blame the borrowers, noting that many of the institutions were not officially licensed or guaranteed by the Central Bank.\n\n\u201cHow many times do you want to be bitten by a snake from the same hole?\u201d asked Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, a government spokesman, in an interview with the semiofficial news agency ILNA. Officials, he added, \u201ctold people several times but still they invested.\u201d\n\nMohammad Bagher Olfat, a Muslim cleric who is deputy chief of the judiciary, said that jilted borrowers shared the blame with the lenders and regulators.\n\n\u201cYes, their money is gone, but they shouldn\u2019t expect the state to pay for their loss,\u201d he told the same news agency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was not just the buyer-beware response of officials in the absence of oversight and transparency that outraged the victims. In 2016, Iranians were scandalized by leaks about the high salaries of executives at state-run companies, including $50,000 bonuses paid to eight managers of a state-owned insurance company (when an Iranian laborer might earn $200 a month).\n\nIn that context, the release of a draft budget that proposed raising outlays for clerics\u2019 pet projects and their families while eliminating the $12 a month cash subsidy provided to 30 million Iranians and raising fuel prices by 50 percent provided the spark that ignited the protests.\n\nThey were upset to read about the $2 million \u2014 a 9 percent increase \u2014 that went to the son of the late Ayatollah Shahab ad-Din Muhammad Hussein Marashi Najafi to maintain his father\u2019s library, and the $15 million provided to the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, to publish the late leader\u2019s works.\n\nBut some Iranians had already had enough. When Mr. Asgari was told in May that Caspian was closing without repaying his $42,000, he stepped outside and checked the encrypted social media app Telegram, where he found many groups for \u201cproperty losers\u201d victimized by Caspian and others like it.\n\n\u201cWe organized demonstrations in front of their head office,\u201d he said. Bowing to pressure, the government eventually refunded most of his original deposit but deducted the three interest payments he had received. (The government has since tried to block the use of Telegram in Iran.)\n\nArash Tajaloo, 42, a civil engineer in Tehran, deposited a total of $414,000 with Caspian in the spring of 2016, when the institution was promising him interest payments of as much as 30 percent a year. Caspian started restricting his withdrawals after six months, offering the excuse of temporary technical problems.\n\n\u201cThey kept buying time, week after week,\u201d he said in an interview over Telegram.\n\nA lawsuit he filed was consolidated into a class action, \u201cgiven the large number of cases,\u201d he said.

They were booed by their hometown fans. The next weekend, no Patriots protested.\n\nPublic opposition quickly died down in Minnesota as well. The Vikings\u2019 owners, Zygi and Mark Wilf, waited two days before speaking out against Trump, then locked arms with their players during the national anthem. The Wilfs issued a statement that never mentioned Trump, and instead spoke of their commitment to \u201cfoster an environment that recognizes and appreciates diversity of thought and encourages using this platform in a constructive manner. Rather than make divisive statements, we believe in promoting thoughtful, inspiring conversation that unifies our communities.\u201d\n\nBy the next weekend, the Vikings were among the dozen teams that had no players protesting.\n\nBut several members of the Jaguars continued to kneel, and Malcolm Jenkins of the Eagles played a leading role in the Players Coalition, a group of players who met regularly with owners and league officials to push the N.F.L. to help address their concerns. Over the opposition of some owners, the league eventually agreed to provide monetary support, a victory not just for Jenkins but for the other players who continued to protest throughout the fall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJenkins remained outspoken.

His Jaguars play in a city dominated by the military. Khan also donated $1 million to the president\u2019s inauguration, but he opposed his ban on immigration from several Muslim majority countries.\n\n\n\nThe Jaguars were the first team to play on Sunday after Trump\u2019s remarks because they were in London to face the Baltimore Ravens. Before the game, the team issued a statement, and then Khan met with several players; Coach Doug Marrone; and Tom Coughlin, the former coach who advises the team.

Time\n\nImage soruce: Getty Images. (Photo: The Motley Fool)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Higher bond yields are finally here, and investors have to consider what, if any, changes to make to their portfolios.\n\nShort-term yields haven't been this high for almost a decade, and long-term yields have also risen. Investors expect rates to keep going up as the economy improves and as the Federal Reserve continues to raises rates above their historically low levels. At the same time, the Fed is letting its huge bond portfolio shrink.\n\nLow bond yields are one of the key reasons stocks have climbed higher and higher in recent years, and it's possible the increase in yields will break stocks out of their pattern of steady gains. Higher bond yields may tempt investors who want income, and they also tend to slow down economic growth by making it more expensive to borrow money, which could be bad for stocks.\n\nJack Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Capital Markets, said higher bond yields have been a long time coming, so investors might not need to make big adjustments just yet. But if yields climb further, Ablin's prepared to make big changes. Bonds could even become more appealing than stocks, which have started to look expensive.\n\nThis photo provided by BMO Wealth Management shows Jack Ablin. After a long period of declines, bond yields are finally moving higher. That could mean big changes for the stock market. Ablin says investors may not need to react to the changes right away, but if yields keep going up after staying low for so long, bonds could become far more appealing, possibly even more than stocks.

High-dividend stocks have already lagged the market, so should investors avoid them now?\n\nA: There are a lot of investors who are income-oriented, so income is a key part of what they're trying to do. I'm not sure we'd necessarily say avoid income. But for the most part we've positioned for higher rates and we just haven't gotten them. So I haven't necessarily changed anything big picture. This rise we expected last year appears to be coming through nowadays. This is probably the longest anticipated bond bear market in history. Now it appears that while the Federal Reserve has curtailed its (easing) program, and many of the global central banks are doing the same.\n\nMore: 7 rules for small biz growth\n\nMore: Ask a Fool: How can I protect against 2018 market correction?\n\nQ: The rise in rates means the prices of many types of bonds are falling. Are any bonds doing well?\n\nA: When Treasury yields rise, that tends to create a competition. You have to look at it asset class by asset class, but in general I would say more high-yield bonds should do well because they have higher coupons and shorter maturities. LIBOR-based floating rates loan should do well.\n\nAnd rates are going up for a couple of reasons, including less buying from the central banks of Europe and Japan. But what's driving the reduced buying from the foreign central banks is better growth. It's that growth that's fueling demand for oil and natural gas.\n\nQ: Most experts expect market volatility to rise this year because it can't stay at historic lows forever. Will that limit the gains for bonds?\n\nA: Treasury yields decline as volatility increases because volatility then increases uncertainty, and in periods of uncertainty, investors tend to clamor for quality. If we see rates rise and volatility pick up, that could attenuate that rate rise or the impact of higher rates.\n\nQ: How high are yields likely to go?\n\nA: I'm not an economist, so I couldn't say. But historically, the yield of the 10-year note has tracked the gross domestic product, and nominal GDP is about 4 percent. So fair value for the 10-year is about 4 percent. That's where it should be, but that's where it should have been a year ago.\n\nYields need to rise about 150 basis points across the board for that to be fair value. If that happens, it's going to create problems for equities because then we'll have some competition. For now, the equity market is the only game in town because the bond yields are so meager. If the yield on the 10-year Treasury gets to 3.5 percent, then I'm selling equities. We have to be prepared for shifting our asset allocations around.\n\nIf rates rise enough, it's going to pull the rug out from under the stock market if the fundamentals don't improve enough.\n\nQ: Since you're thinking about selling stocks and buying bonds if yields rise further, what do you expect stocks to do in the shorter term?\n\nA: I think the stock market can be up high single digits or low double digits this year. While the tax plan may be priced in, I'm not sure the beneficial impact of those taxes is fully priced in. It's not just the repatriation of $2 trillion that could perhaps find its way into the equity market. We could see capital expenditures and business spending rise.\n\nAnd countries including Germany and Japan view this tax rate as a shot across the bow. They're threatened by it. It's possible they could match our plans with similar plans and then we get a race to the bottom. The primary beneficiaries would be companies and shareholders.\n\nMore: Follow USA TODAY Money and Tech on Facebook\n\nCLOSE The Dow posted triple digit gains Wednesday, turbocharged by tech stocks like Microsoft and IBM.

At that shutdown\u2019s peak, 850,000 federal employees were furloughed for a total of 6.6 million workdays. Paying them for days not worked cost $2 billion.\n\nPrivate-sector employment is also affected. The 2013 shutdown cut job creation in the sector by about 120,000 over two weeks, the Council of Economic Advisers estimated in an analysis conducted immediately afterward. \u201cA range of indicators show that sentiment, job creation, consumption, and some elements of production grew more slowly in the first half of October than in previous months,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nAs a whole, shutdowns cost the economy at least 0.1 percentage point of growth per week, and probably much more, the Congressional Research Service surmised in a report in 2014. A separate report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of a larger analysis by the Congressional Research Service, found that lost hours worked by federal employees over the two weeks of the shutdown in 2013 accounted for a 0.3 percentage point drop in quarterly growth \u2014 by themselves.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers estimates that every week of furloughing federal workers would reduce annual economic growth by 0.2 percentage point.\n\nAnother shutdown would trim at least $6.5 billion a week from the nation\u2019s economic output, economists at Standard & Poor\u2019s suggested. \u201cA shutdown affects not only Washington and its employees, but also has ripple effects across sectors throughout the country \u2014 from shopping malls to national parks, from contractors to hotels,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at S.&P.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJob recruiters worried that a shutdown could also slow hiring. \u201cWe face a very real risk of a national hiring hesitation, with recruiters putting plans on hold, and job movers opting to sit tight for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Doug Monro, a founder of the global job search engine Adzuna.\n\nAnd then there are the consequences for Wall Street. The nearly monthlong shutdown in 1995-96 coincided with a 5 percent drop in stock prices. \u201cCertainly the stock market has been on a tear and proved quite resilient,\u201d said Nancy Vanden Houten, a senior economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a brief shutdown would bother the markets all that much,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the longer it lasts, the more likely it is to affect financial markets.\u201d\n\nAfter recent gains, stocks \u201cmight be a little more vulnerable to a sell-off,\u201d she added.\n\nSo far, markets have not reacted adversely. United States stock futures were trading upward on Saturday afternoon, well after the shutdown began. But analysts warned last week that traders could be spooked if they grow to believe a shutdown bodes poorly for raising the federal debt limit this spring, in time to prevent a government default on debt.\n\n\u201cWhile a government shutdown only risks delayed payments for discretionary spending categories,\u201d analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote, \u201ca Treasury default driven by the debt ceiling could be catastrophic for the U.S. Treasury market and other macro markets in general.\u201d", "title": "The Longer It Lasts, the More a Shutdown Could Hurt the Economy", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/us/politics/economy-government-shutdown.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T20:59:20Z"}, {"textData": "In February 2015, shortly after Greece\u2019s new anti-bailout government swept to power with promises of ending austerity, a little-known European official flew to Athens on a secret trip to deliver a message, the ramifications of which continue to reverberate today.\n\nSitting down with a small group of government ministers, the Austrian economist spelled out the consequences of Greece defaulting on its loans. First, the country would be cut off from the international funds needed to pay salaries and pensions. As capital flight ensued, banks would collapse and the economy would follow. His audience, however, wasn\u2019t convinced, until his prophesies were all but realized six months later.\n\nThomas Wieser Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg\n\nThe trip, orchestrated by higher powers in Brussels and Berlin, highlights the key role played behind the scenes by Thomas Wieser, head of the influential euro-working group, in helping quell the crisis that racked the euro area. As Wieser now prepares to leave his post at the helm of one of the bloc\u2019s most powerful bodies later this month, the lessons learned during those turbulent times are informing the debate among governments on how to strengthen the 19-nation currency region.\n\nThe mandarin\u2019s departure signals the end of an era for the old guard who faced unprecedented financial calamity, while the bloc\u2019s attention has shifted from managing chaos to avoiding it altogether. On Monday, euro-area finance ministers will appoint Dutch Treasury Director General Hans Vijlbrief to succeed Wieser, in a meeting that will otherwise focus on further steps to complete the bloc\u2019s banking union and develop its crisis-fighting fund.\n\nGreek Pasta\n\nThe sharp-witted 63-year-old Wieser is little known outside EU institutions and finance ministries. But from his office on the third floor of the gray Justus Lipsius European Council building in Brussels -- where leaders have held countless emergency summits -- he has overseen the euro\u2019s ascension, transformation and brush with disintegration.\n\nSince 2012, Wieser has led the officials that prepare the monthly meetings of euro-area finance ministers, known as Eurogroup. The so-called EWG was notoriously powerful during the crisis, green-lighting emergency loans and leading discussions on issues such as banking rule overhauls and the bloc\u2019s crisis-fighting apparatus.\n\nOne month after his 2015 trip failed to convince the Greeks to drop their brinkmanship, tensions between Athens and its creditors were growing, and Wieser was back on a plane to Greece for a second clandestine mission. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had invited Greek Premier Alexis Tsipras to Berlin in an effort to break the deadlock, and Wieser\u2019s mission was to ensure the Athens\u2019s delegation was up to the task. Over pasta and chicken at then-finance minister\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s house, he attempted to prepare the Greeks for their first visit to the Chancellery.\n\nThe surreptitious trip was characteristic of Wieser who, while never in the limelight, was always in the center of countless critical efforts that ensured the euro survived its greatest crisis yet.\n\n\u201cThomas Wieser is a man who advances without seeking fame,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner in charge of the euro, said in an interview. \u201cHe is one of these skilled statesmen who will be little known to the large public, yet without whom history would not be the same.\u201d\n\nSquaring the Circle\n\nWieser\u2019s departure at the end of January, which aligns with the end of Eurogroup Chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s tenure, will likely rob the group of depth and experience just as the euro area enters a critical junction. With the worst of its crisis behind it, and helped by the election of deeper-integration advocate Emmanuel Macron in France, the bloc is now looking at strengthening itself in the face of future financial turmoil.\n\nNormalcy Returns Thomas Wieser and Jeroen Dijsselbloem led the Eurogroup during the peak of the crisis Source: Eurostat\n\n\u201cAs the first permanent EWG chairperson, Thomas Wieser leaves huge shoes to fill,\u201d said Klaus Regling, the managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, the euro-area bailout fund that was itself born out of one such crisis-meeting. \u201cHe was one of the key persons to ensure that the euro area has overcome the crisis successfully and that the integrity of the currency union remained intact.\u201d\n\nFew cases illustrate Wieser\u2019s role in the euro\u2019s survival better than his involvement in Greece. Whenever the country and its creditors failed to see eye-to-eye, he was among the few tasked with squaring the circle, even as everyone else had given up.\n\nAfter a Eurogroup meeting in July 2015 concluded prematurely because the atmosphere had become too toxic, Wieser, together with Dijsselbloem, stayed until the early hours and, to the surprise of all sides, hammered out an acceptable compromise, a version of which was eventually agreed upon by euro-area leaders in a deal that brought Greece back from the brink.\n\n\u2018Linchpin\u2019\n\nTo many EU officials, Wieser is the ultimate Brussels eurocrat: He\u2019s deeply knowledgeable, technically proficient and has an an understanding of the political pitfalls his group\u2019s decisions will face in EU capitals. To some critics, though, he represents the faceless \u201cBrussels\u201d behind demands for tough austerity inflicted upon Europe\u2019s citizens by unelected officials sitting miles away in Belgium.\n\nStill, revered or loathed, few doubt the role he played in the euro\u2019s most critical hours.\n\nSpeaking after a summit on the future of the euro-area in December, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called the soon-departing Wieser \u201cthe linchpin of the Eurogroup.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout him much would not have been possible, and thanks to him much was made possible,\u201d Juncker said.", "title": "Euro-Area \u2018Linchpin\u2019 Departs as Bloc Seeks to Start New Chapter", "sourceId": "bloomberg", "sourceName": "Bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-21/euro-area-linchpin-departs-as-bloc-seeks-to-start-new-chapter", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T05:00:01Z"}, {"textData": "In a fiery speech at a MoveOn rally outside the Capitol on Friday evening, Gutierrez accused President Donald Trump of exposing himself as a racist with his \u201cshithole\u201d countries remarks.

While separate bipartisan immigration talks had been underway, Democrats demanded a DACA fix as part of the continuing resolution (CR) -- requiring Republicans to try in vain to cobble together the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.\n\nThe subsequent 50-49 vote broke largely along party lines, with five Republicans voting no, and five Democrats voting yes.\n\nOn Saturday, although both the House and the Senate were in session, both sides seemed more focused on pushing their respective narratives about who was to blame for the crisis.\n\nWhen McConnell, R-Ky, addressed lawmakers Saturday evening, he urged his Democratic counterpart, Sen.

Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said at a briefing that Schumer had in fact offered only $1.8 billion in funding for the wall, far short of the roughly $20 billion Trump wanted. Mulvaney said Schumer still told Trump that he was giving him everything he wanted.\n\n\u201cDoes it even become profitable to work with someone like that?\u201d Mulvaney asked reporters.\n\nA sign of the bitterness of the blame game came from the White House comments line, where a voicemail blamed Democrats for users being unable to use the line.\n\n\u201cThank you for calling the White House, unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are withholding government funding, including funding for our troops and other national security priorities, hostage to an unrelated immigration debate.

The joint march and the unified hockey team were approved Saturday by the International Olympic Committee, which allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the games in exceptional entries given to the North.\n\nNot all South Koreans are in the mood. There are apparently few objections to the North Korean presence at the Olympics itself, which likely ensures that the country holds off any significant weapons test or other aggressive acts that would risk disrupting the games.\n\nMany South Koreans believe their government went too far by pushing athletes into a \"political show\" that will likely become meaningless once the lull in tensions breaks down after the Olympics.\n\nKim Hye-jin, a 39-year-old music instructor, said that South Korea was repeating an \"outdated approach\" in using sports diplomacy. She said that the previous unified teams and joint marches between the rivals never paved the way for sustained, meaningful engagement.\n\n\"We are always repeating meaningless things and North Korea isn't a country that will change easily,\" she said.\n\nPlus, she said, a unified team takes away opportunities from South Korean athletes who have been working hard to prepare for the Olympics.\n\nHeo Doo-won, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, didn't care for the reconciliatory gestures at all.\n\n\"Why are we doing this?\" he asked. \"We are clearly two different countries and it's better if things stay that way. I don't want a unified team or a unification flag. Why can't we just let the North Koreans march under their own flag?\"\n\nWhile the liberal Moon remains a popular president nine months into his term, the controversy over the hockey team factored in his approval rating dipping below 70 percent for the first time in four months, according to a Gallup Korea report on Friday.\n\nMany people sympathize with the South Korean athletes who would likely be sacrificing opportunities for the North's players, who are considered less skilled and experienced. The IOC approved an expanded roster of 35 instead of 22 for the joint team, but only the normal number will be allowed to suit up for each game and three of them must be North Korean.\n\nThe South Korean team's Canadian coach, Sarah Murray, has expressed concerns over chemistry.\n\n\"Adding somebody so close to the Olympics is a little bit dangerous just for team chemistry because the girls have been together for so long,\" she said last week.\n\nChoi Hyuk, a 40-year-old office worker, blamed the government for failing to properly communicate with the players and for excessively politicizing sports.\n\nChoi pointed to the comments of Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, who was forced to apologize after saying that the South Korean women's hockey team was out of \"medal range\" anyway while defending the government's decision to create the unified team.\n\n\"South Korea's elite sports have always been based on nationalism,\" Choi said, referring to a decades-long system that rewards Olympic medal winners with lifelong cash payments and exemption from military duties that are mandatory for most able-bodied men.\n\n\"Isn't it funny that the same country is now asking athletes to cut back on their playing time and embrace changes that would make them less likely to win?\"\n\nThe reconciliation mood between the Koreas began after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year's speech that he was willing to send a delegation to the Olympics.\n\nSome experts view Kim's overture as an attempt to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and buy time to further advance his nuclear weapons program. Last year, North Korea carried out its sixth and biggest nuclear test and test-fired three intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has shown no willingness to give up its ambitions.\n\nStill, many experts think Moon's government made the right move in jumping at the opportunity to resume contact with North Korea after nearly two years of diplomatic stalemate and animosity.\n\nIn an annual policy report on Friday, South Korea's Unification Ministry said it aims to use the Olympics as an opportunity to re-establish regular dialogue with North Korea. The resumption of inter-Korean talks is crucial for the policies of Moon, who wants Seoul in the driver's seat in international efforts to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat.\n\nThe Koreas sent joint teams to major international sporting events twice in 1991, and had their athletes march together in the opening and closing ceremonies of several sporting events in the 2000s, including the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile the previous moves had little diplomatic impact, similar gestures would carry more meaning in an Olympics held on South Korean soil and amid higher stakes in regional security, said Yongchul Chung, a sports education professor at Seoul's Sogang University.\n\n\"Fielding a unified team is very meaningful \u2014 the biggest fruit that can come from the Pyeongchang Olympics is a message of peace between the Koreas,\" Chung said. \"It's not like the players wouldn't understand the historic significance of what they are involved in.\"\n\nBut it has become harder to get South Koreans excited for unified teams and joint marches when North Korea's increasingly aggressive weapons tests and the South's own evolvement as an economy and society continue to erode the public's enthusiasm for reunification.\n\nIn a survey of 1,200 adults released by Seoul National University in October, 53.8 percent of the respondents said they supported the idea of reunification. This represented a steep drop from the 63.8 percent measured in 2007, when the school started the annual survey.\n\n\"I think it will be emotionally moving to watch the athletes of both Koreas march under the same flag during the opening ceremony as we come from the same nation,\" said Oh Ju-yeon, a 46-year-old housewife. \"But after the games, there will be bitterness from realizing that nothing's really going to change.\"", "title": "Not all South Koreans are happy about unified hockey team", "sourceId": "abc-news", "sourceName": "ABC News", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-koreans-happy-unified-hockey-team-52495628", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T03:55:36Z"}, {"textData": "\nA former assistant police chief for a Kentucky police department allegedly instructed a police recruit to shoot black minors if he were to catch them smoking marijuana, according to court documents.\n\n\nIn an Aug. 31 letter to Prospect, Kentucky Mayor John Evans, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell wrote that he has \"serious concerns\" about the then-assistant police chief Todd Shaw, who at the time was acting chief for the city of Prospect, a suburban city in the Louisville metropolitan area.\n\n\nWhen senior Jefferson County prosecutors met with members of the Louisville Metro Police Department, they reviewed \"highly disturbing racist and threatening Facebook private messages\" Shaw exchanged with a former LMPD police recruit, the letter states.

The recruit appears to have come to Shaw for advice, telling him, \"I'm so confused about this paper,\" in the message, dated Oct. 5, 2016.\n\n\n\"F--- the right thing,\" Shaw allegedly wrote. \"If black shoot them.\"\n\n\nShaw allegedly made other \"racially threatening statements,\" which included instructions on \"how to handle the juveniles' parents,\" according to the letter.\n\n\n\"...if mom is hot then f--- her,\" Shaw allegedly wrote. \"...if dad is hot then handcuff him and make him s--- my d---.\"\n\n\nShaw allegedly continued, \"Unless daddy is black...Then shoot him...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another alleged message, dated Sept. 24, 2016, the recruit told Shaw that he didn't think he will be the class leader in his recruit class because a former corrections officer was in the class. Shaw then allegedly told that recruit that he was required to sign a form saying he \"wasn't racist or associated with racists or associated with racist or hate groups per some KY law.\"\n\n\n\"What has POLICING come to when all you can shoot are white people and injured deer,\" Shaw allegedly wrote. \"Lol.\"\n\n\n\"As Jefferson County Attorney, I feel compelled to notify and warn you of Shaw's deeply offensive and racist statements,\" O'Connell wrote to the mayor. \"There is no place in police departments for men or women who hold such strongly held prejudices, including recommending shooting people simply because of their race.\"\n\n\nO'Connell stressed how \"disturbing\" it was that a senior law enforcement officer with more than 20 years of experience was expressing racist views to a \"young recruit.\"\n\n\nThe letter to the mayor included attachments of the relevant Facebook messages and copied in other relevant officials, including the Prospect Police Chief and the Louisville Metro Police Chief.\n\n\nIn another alleged message on April 8, 2017, Shaw allegedly referred to Martin Luther King Jr. as \"nothing but a [racist] womanizer.\"\n\n\n\"But because someone shot him, I get a day off with pay each year so I will take it,\" the message allegedly stated.\n\n\nShaw also allegedly wrote on March 6, 2017 that he needed \"target practice\" when referring to the \"revitalized Russell neighborhood,\" named after African-American educator and Kentucky native Harvey Clarence Russell.\n\n\nOn Thursday, Shaw filed a motion for a restraining order or temporary injunction in a Jefferson County circuit court, seeking to have the Facebook records deemed exempt from inspection, according to court documents. The motion was denied.\n\n\nSince Shaw was the assistant police chief and acting chief for Prospect as the time of his resignation, \"that responsibility lends itself to a higher level of public scrutiny,\" Judge Judith McDonald-Burkman states in the court document.\n\n\n\"While the Court understands how embarrassing the documents may be to Shaw personally, they are not of the private nature intended to be shielded from public disclosure,\" McDonald-Burkman wrote. \"The documents reveal opinions and prejudices that bring into question Shaw's integrity as a law enforcement officer who has been entrusted to serve and protect all members of society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaw has not been charged with any crime as a result of the records, the motion states.\n\n\nMichael Burns, an attorney who represents Shaw in the civil case, told the Louisville Courier Journal that Shaw, throughout his police career, \"treated all people fairly and respectfully regardless of their race.\"\n\n\n\"His Facebook messages were made privately between colleagues and friends who shared the reality of being police officers in today\u2019s culture where police are demonized and demoralized for doing what is required to keep the community safe,\" Burns told the paper. \"Actions speak louder than words and Mr. Shaw\u2019s actions during his career speak for themselves.

They endanger Americans\u2019 lives by keeping criminal illegal aliens on the streets of American cities. \u00a0\nThe\u00a0Kate\u00a0Steinle\u00a0murder\u00a0in San Francisco\u00a0was just\u00a0one of thousands of cases of Americans who lost their lives because of sanctuary policies. \u00a0Sanctuary policies\u00a0also endanger our constitutional system. \u00a0Sanctuary policies violate the federal\u00a0law\u00a0found at 8 U.S.C. 1373(a); and 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) makes it a federal\u00a0crime\u00a0to \u201cencourage or induce\u201d an illegal alien to remain in\u00a0the country. \u00a0When cities and states openly defy federal law, it threatens our constitutional system in the same manner that the defiant states did during the Jim Crow era.\nSo we have two national battles occurring simultaneously. \u00a0And in both battles,\u00a0Democratic leaders are putting the interests of illegal aliens over the interests of American citizens.\nThe first duty of government is to protect its own citizens. \u00a0It\u2019s so obvious that it seems silly to even have to say it. \u00a0But the leaders of the\u00a0Democratic Party have apparently forgotten that basic principle.\nIf they continue on this course,\u00a0Democratic leaders\u00a0will do damage not only to the country, but to their own party.\u00a0\u00a0A party\u2019s leadership can get away with a lot of nonsense in Washington, D.C., but some things cross the line. \u00a0If\u00a0they\u00a0continue on this course for much longer, there will likely be\u00a0millions of Democrats across the country\u00a0who\u00a0no longer recognize their own party. \u00a0They still rightly expect their government to put the interests of American citizens first.\nKris W.

Wade, when the high court\u00a0created\u00a0a right to abortion, although none existed in the Constitution.\nIn May 2013, Philadelphia area abortionist Kermit Gosnell was found guilty of murdering babies who survived abortion by cutting their spinal cords.\nIn a statement sent to Breitbart News, Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said the Born Alive measure \u201cis the bare minimum that a humane society should offer to newborns.\u201d\n\u201cIt should be obvious that a baby, born and alive outside of the womb, should receive medical care if he or she needs it,\u201d Hawkins continued. \u201cAdding criminal penalties for the so-called medical professionals who stand there and allow a baby to die is absolutely appropriate, especially when you consider that they have the skills to aid the struggling young infant.\u201d\nHawkins added it is \u201ctragic that such a law is needed at all.\u201d\nA newly released Marist poll\u00a0finds\u00a0that 76 percent of Americans favor restricting abortion to \u2013 at most \u2013 the first three months of pregnancy.", "title": "Planned Parenthood Condemns House Passage of Bill to Ensure Babies Born Alive During Abortion Receive Care", "sourceId": "breitbart-news", "sourceName": "Breitbart News", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/20/planned-parenthood-condemns-house-passage-of-bill-to-ensure-babies-born-alive-during-abortion-receive-care/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T03:10:49Z"}, {"textData": "The Washington Post identified at least six politically influential Russians who attended President Donald Trump's inaugural celebrations last year.\n\nLobbyists Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin attended the festivities, as did gun rights activist Maria Butina, who used to serve as an assistant to Russian banker Alexander Torshin.\n\nVeselnitskaya, Akhmetshin, and Torshin are all being scrutinized by investigators probing Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nThe two Russian lobbyists who met with then-candidate Donald Trump's top campaign officials at Trump Tower in June 2016 also attended the inaugural festivities when he was sworn in as president seven months later, The Washington Post reported.\n\nOne of the lobbyists, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is a Kremlin-connected lawyer who lobbies aggressively against the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which blacklisted powerful Russians suspected of human-rights abuses. The other lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, is a former Soviet military intelligence officer and an ally of Veselnitskaya who also advocates against the Magnitsky Act.\n\nBoth attended a party on Inauguration Day last year at the Library of Congress that was sponsored by Russia-friendly Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's campaign committee, The Post reported.\n\nIt was not the first time Rohrabacher had interacted with Veselnitskaya. The two also met in Moscow in April 2016 to discuss issues related to the Magnitsky Act, a law Russian President Vladimir Putin has derided as a \"purely political, unfriendly act.\"\n\nVeselnitskaya and Akhmetshin invited scrutiny last July, when news of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting first broke. Trump Jr. said in response to initial reports about the meeting that they discussed Russian adoptions and not campaign business. He was forced to amend his statement, however, when it emerged that he accepted the meeting after being offered kompromat on then Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nThat meeting, its attendees, and the Trump campaign's subsequent response have been a red-hot focus for special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional intelligence committees investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn addition to Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin \u2014 both of whom are under FBI scrutiny \u2014 at least four other politically influential Russians attended Trump's Inauguration Day celebrations last year, according to The Post.\n\n'Kremlin Connection'\n\nWealthy Russian pharmaceutical executive Alexey Repik and his wife were there, as was energy tycoon Viktor Vekselberg. Vekselberg is said to be closely aligned with Putin, with whom he frequently meets to discuss business. According to federal filings reviewed by The Post, two of Vekselberg's American associates donated a combined $1.25 million to Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nAlso in attendance was Russian presidential candidate Boris Titov. Though Titov is running as a liberal-leaning competitor to Putin in the country's 2018 presidential race, he is part of the Kremlin establishment and is friends with the Russian leader, according to The Moscow Times.\n\nAvid gun rights activist Maria Butina was also there. The Daily Beast reported last year that Butina has referred to herself at various times as a Russian central bank staffer, a gun enthusiast, a graduate student (she studies at American University in Washington, D.C.), a journalist, \"a representative of the Russian Federation,\" and a link between the Trump campaign and Russia. She also served as an assistant to Putin-allied Russian banker and politician Alexander Torshin, who has been accused in the past of money laundering and other financial crimes.\n\nButina had a birthday party on November 12, 2016, four days after Trump was elected, at a cafe near American University, according to the report. The gathering featured several top Trump campaign advisers and National Rifle Association activist and Republican strategist Paul Erickson, who reportedly told attendees Butina was on the Trump transition team. Butina and Erickson have been acquainted since at least 2013, and Erickson has touted himself as being well-connected to the Kremlin.\n\nErickson invited scrutiny last year, when The New York Times reported that he emailed Trump campaign aide Rick Dearborn in May 2016, with the subject line \"Kremlin Connection,\" telling him that he could arrange a backdoor meeting between Trump and Putin.\n\nRussia is \"quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the US,\" Erickson wrote, according to the email, which was described to The Times. He added that Russia would try to make contact with the Trump campaign at the NRA's annual convention in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTorshin was the individual designated to make \"first contact\" with Trump from Russia's side. Erickson described him in his email as \"President Putin's emissary on this front.\"\n\nErickson wrote that Torshin would make \"first contact\" with the campaign at a dinner honoring wounded veterans that was organized by conservative Christian advocate Rick Clay, the report said. Neither Trump nor his campaign advisers attended the reception. Trump Jr. and Torshin did, however, attend a separate NRA dinner the same night.\n\nInvestigators are said to be reviewing the correspondence and any others related to Dearborn, Erickson, Clay, and Torshin. The FBI, in particular, appears to be homing in on Torshin's role in leveraging the NRA to influence the US election.\n\nMcClatchy reported this week that the bureau is looking into whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA to help sway the race in Trump's favor. The NRA, according to the report, said it spent a record $55 million on the election, most of which came from a sector of the organization that isn't required to disclose its donors.\n\nThe US's former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, told The Post it was \"strange\" that so many Putin-linked individuals attended Trump's inauguration.\n\nBut Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who served as Senior Director of the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said he wasn't surprised.\n\n\"This team courted and potentially colluded with the Russians since day one without any apparent shame,\" he said in an email. \"I would've been surprised had prominent Russians NOT attended the inauguration.

Lookout security researcher Michael Flossman said the trove ran the gamut, from Syrian battlefield photos to private phone conversations, passwords and pictures of children's birthday parties.\n\n\"It was everything. Literally everything,\" Flossman said.\n\nDiscoveries of state-sponsored cyberespionage campaigns have become commonplace as countries in the Middle East and Asia scramble to match the digital prowess of the United States, China, Russia and other major powers. But Lookout and EFF's report is unusual for the amount of data uncovered about the spying campaign's victims and its operators.\n\nNotably, their report drew on data generated by suspected test devices \u2014 a set of similarly configured phones that appear to have been used to try out the spy software \u2014 to potentially pinpoint the hackers' exact address.\n\nThe report said the suspected test devices all seemed to have connected to a WiFi network active at the intersection of Beirut's Pierre Gemayel and Damascus Streets, the location of the bulky, sandstone-colored high-rise that houses Lebanon's General Directorate of General Security. The Associated Press was able to at least partially verify that finding, sending a reporter to the area around the heavily guarded, antenna-crowned building Wednesday to confirm that the same WiFi network was still broadcasting there.\n\nOther data also points to the intelligence agency: the report said the internet protocol addresses of the spyware's control panels mapped to an area just south of the GDGS building.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation Director of Cybersecurity Eva Galperin said the find was remarkable, explaining that she could think of only one other example where researchers were able to pin state-backed hackers to a specific building.\n\n\"We were able to take advantage of extraordinarily poor operational security,\" she said.\n\nThe GDGS did not immediately comment on the report.\n\nThe 49-page document lays out how spies used a network of bogus websites and malicious smartphone apps \u2014 such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Threema and Signal \u2014 to steal passwords or pry into communications, eavesdropping on conversations and capturing at least 486,000 text messages. Some victims were tricked into visiting the websites or downloading the rogue apps by booby trapped messages sent over WhatsApp, the report said. Others may have had malicious programs installed physically when they were away from their phones. Still more may have been lured into compromising their devices by a set of apparently fake Facebook profiles set up to look like attractive young Lebanese women.\n\nEFF and Lookout said the spying stretched over 21 different countries, including the United States and several European nations, but they declined to identify any of the victims except in general terms, saying that there were thousands of them and that in many cases it wasn't always obvious who they were.\n\nMurray said relevant authorities had been notified of the spying but declined to go into further detail.\n\nLebanon has historically been a hub for espionage and Lebanese spies have a documented interest in surveillance software. In 2015, for example, the internet watchdog group Citizen Lab published evidence that GDGS had tapped FinFisher, a spyware merchant whose tools have been used to hack into the computers of several African and Middle Eastern dissidents.\n\nThe hacking campaign exposed Thursday by EFF and Lookout \u2014 which they dub \"Dark Caracal\" \u2014 was discovered in the wake of an entirely different cyberespionage campaign targeting Kazakh journalists and lawyers.\n\nAn EFF report on the Kazakh campaign published in 2016 caught the attention of researchers at Lookout, who swept through the company's vast store of smartphone data to find a sample of the smartphone surveillance software mentioned in the write-up. It was while pulling on that string that investigators stumbled across the open server full of photos, conversations and intercepted text messages \u2014 as well as the link to Lebanon.\n\nGalperin and Murray both said researchers were marshalling more evidence and that more revelations were coming.\n\n\"Stay tuned,\" Murray said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nEFF and Lookout's report: https://www.lookout.com/info/ds-dark-caracal-ty\n\n___\n\nRaphael Satter can be reached at: http://raphaelsatter.com", "title": "Report links hacking campaign to Lebanese security agency", "sourceId": "associated-press", "sourceName": "Associated Press", "url": "https://apnews.com/c78ef443167540cbbff2b1f8f3af2772", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T02:12:00Z"}, {"textData": "BONN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s center-left Social Democrats (SPD) will decide on Sunday whether to start formal coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives, a move which would bring Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse one step closer to a stable government.\n\nSPD leader Martin Schulz is facing a strong backlash from the party\u2019s left and youth wings, which argue that the SPD should reinvent itself in opposition after scoring its worst election result in September since Germany became a federal republic in 1949.\n\nAround 600 delegates, meeting in Bonn, will debate and vote on whether their leaders should push ahead with coalition talks on renewing an alliance with Merkel\u2019s conservatives that took office in 2013.\n\nThe two blocs, which both bled support to the far right in the Sept. 24 election, struck a preliminary deal last week but critics, including the party\u2019s youth wing leader Kevin Kuehnert, say the agreed blueprint does not bear enough of the SPD\u2019s hallmarks.\n\nSunday\u2019s vote will also be watched closely abroad as Germany has Europe\u2019s largest economy and Merkel has long played a leading role in the continent\u2019s economic and security affairs.\n\nSenior Social Democrats have cited progress in efforts to win support for formal talks after the SPD\u2019s biggest regional branch in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) recommended its members vote in favor of entering negotiations - on condition that Schulz push for more concessions on labor, health and migration policies.\n\nSPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles said she expected formal talks to happen. \u201cNevertheless, I ask everyone in my party to take responsibility: Please consider the consequences if this government option fails,\u201d she told Welt am Sonntag.\n\nMartin Schulz, leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) inspects the convention hall prior to the SPD's one-day party congress in Bonn, Germany, January 20, 2018.

If the government is still shut down, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to stay home from work and the true scale of the crisis will start to hit the American public, raising the noise level of the fight dramatically. For Republicans, the issue is keeping President Donald Trump from a major mistake, making him the focus and not Democrats.\nSo far, the GOP has hit the \"illegal immigration\" angle hardest.\n\u201cDonald Trump was elected President to build the wall and keep American families safe from evil, illegal immigrants who commit violent crimes against lawful U.S. citizens,\u201d asserts a web ad released by the Trump campaign on Saturday afternoon. It includes pictures of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \u201cYet, one year after President Trump\u2019s Inauguration, Chuck Schumer and the Democrats continue to put the interests of illegal immigrants over those of Americans.\u201d \nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders chimed in as well: \u201cWe will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators.\u201d\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY.) invoked the \u201cDemocrats are supporting illegal immigration\u201d line, too, tagging Schumer on the Senate floor Saturday. \u201cBut like the president, like the House, and like a bipartisan majority of senators, the American people cannot begin to understand why the Senate Democratic leader thinks the entire government should be shut down until he gets his way on illegal immigration,\u201d McConnell said.\nSign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\nBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) denounced the Trump ad as \u201cvile.\u201d\nSchumer \u2014 in by far his biggest moment as Senate minority leader \u2014 has largely held his caucus together so far, including several red state Democrats up for reelection in 2018. Five of those vulnerable senators did cross the aisle and vote with McConnell on Friday.\nWhether Schumer can keep his troops in line under pressure from Trump, McConnell and the entire GOP political machine is the big question, especially if the shutdown extends into next week or beyond.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this political world, in the most toxic place in that world \u2014 Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), who is running for another term in November. Manchin voted with Republicans Friday night to fund the government for four more weeks. \u201cWith that being said, everyone should be working together to get this government open.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s misrepresenting us, of course. He does that on a regular basis,\u201d Sen. Bob Casey (Pa.), another Democrat up this year, said of McConnell. Casey opposed the GOP funding proposal. \u201cIf he wanted to bring the country together, he\u2019d be fighting for his coal miners like I\u2019m fighting for mine.\u201d\nDemocrats also criticized Republicans for the controversy over Dreamers in the first place, noting that it was Trump who decided in September to end protections granted to recipients under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program initiated by President Barack Obama.\n\u201cWhy does he call them illegals? Who made them illegal?\u201d asked Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) of McConnell. \u201cWhen he stands up and calls DACA kids illegal immigrants \u2014 they are [actually] legal. They got protection from the president.

Several of them said there had not been much dissension, and that the caucus remains united behind Schumer and the leadership. Still, lawmakers in both parties acknowledged that the real pressure won\u2019t begin until Monday. Many Republicans are convinced Schumer will fold before then.\nDemocrats also believe that in Trump, they have a villain they can successfully tag with causing the shutdown.

If even Prince, a famous teetotaler with access to the best medical care, could end up addicted to painkillers, surely that would show that the opioid epidemic was reaching every corner of America. Maybe in death, his celebrity could illuminate the high stakes of the crisis and force a reckoning.\nWe were very wrong. More than 55,000 Americans\u2014rich, poor, famous and not\u2014have since died from their own opioid overdoses. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that the death rate in 2018 could be even worse. And Friday night\u2019s news that rock star Tom Petty died from his own preventable painkiller overdose, more than a year after Prince, underscores how far there is to go.\nStory Continued Below\nIn health care, there\u2019s a quest for celebrity patients\u2014a symbol who can galvanize change. It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s worked before. Ryan White, a teenager in the 1980s, became the face of HIV/AIDS and helped drive research and reforms. More recently, actor Michael J. Fox raised awareness of Parkinson\u2019s disease; Angelina Jolie\u2019s op-ed about her breast cancer risk spurred a spike in genetic testing.\nThat hasn\u2019t really happened with painkiller deaths, perhaps because there are too many famous faces to pick from. Actors like Heath Ledger and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Musicians like Prince and Petty. And it\u2019s far from a new trend. Even Elvis Presley, who died 41 years ago, was dealing with painkiller addiction.\nA celebrity\u2019s death from painkillers also has lost its ability to shock and awe. \u201cNo one is surprised when they hear about a rock star dying of a drug overdose,\u201d said Andrew Koldony, an addiction expert at Brandeis University. \u201cIn some ways, it reinforces the stigma around addiction or that it only happens because of a certain lifestyle. Of course, that\u2019s not true at all.\u201d\nPrince and Petty, for instance, were both dealing with chronic pain\u2014like millions of everyday Americans\u2014and seemingly got hooked on drugs in their attempts to manage it. Petty\u2019s family said he played 53 separate shows while using legally prescribed medication to deal with a broken hip; his death was reportedly an accidental overdose of a mix of those legal drugs.\nThe details of Prince\u2019s death remain less clear, but investigators note that he had apparently overdosed just six days earlier, after a performance, and was administered an emergency recovery drug\u2014a worrying sign of the depth of his addiction. He also had been hiding a mix of different painkillers in aspirin bottles, with at least some of those medicines apparently prescribed to his bodyguard for privacy. Prince had suffered ankle and hip problems for years, with multiple reports that he\u2019d undergone major hip surgery\nNeither celebrity was blind to the risks. Petty had previously beaten a heroin addiction; Prince was scheduled to meet with an expert for painkiller treatment the day after he died.\n\u201cPrince was not a drug abuser\u201d in the traditional sense of celebrity rockers, Kolodny stressed. \u201cHe was a religious guy. He was a vegetarian. You couldn\u2019t smoke pot or drink alcohol on tour with him.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a deeper reason why a celebrity death hasn\u2019t arrested the opioid crisis: The problems are systemic, and too entrenched to be shaken by a few high-profile victims. About 91 people now die from opioid overdoses every day, the CDC says\u2014a conservative estimate\u2014thanks to a potent mix of stigmas, addictions, lack of awareness and inadequate access to care and prevention.\n\u201cToo many people still think it\u2019s a moral failing,\u201d said Regina LaBelle, a drug policy official in the Obama administration. \u201cToo many doctors don\u2019t screen for or recognize addiction, so we have too much untreated addiction.\u201d\nThe opioid epidemic has also made some pharmaceutical companies very rich, a real barrier to getting the industry to buy into change. Sales of prescription opioids almost quadrupled between 1999 and 2014 as the number of prescriptions soared. By 2010, there were more than eight opioid prescriptions for every 10 people. Purdue Pharma, the makers of OxyContin, have sold more than $25 billion worth of the drug in the past decade.\nMeanwhile, more than 250,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the past decade. Some projections say that could double in the decade ahead, under worst-case scenarios.\nIt\u2019s a public health crisis that largely unfolded with little attention, and perhaps that\u2019s one way that a celebrity death can help: The news of what killed Petty will trigger another round of articles about the epidemic, an issue that the media largely missed for years. While a July 2001 New York Times magazine article was the first at the Gray Lady to frame the opioid problem in terms like \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201cepidemic,\u201d it wasn\u2019t until 2014 that the Times began routinely using that shorthand.\nBeyond raising public awareness, increased media coverage has real resonance in Washington, by forcing politicians to reckon with an issue. And many congressmen also ignored opioid issues until the past few years, focusing their health care advocacy instead on political issues like the Affordable Care Act or more traditional causes like cancer. The last White House wasn\u2019t much better.\n\u201cPresident Obama neglected the epidemic,\u201d Kolodny said, noting that the Obama administration\u2019s flurry of activity\u2014which included a surge in funding for opioid-specific issues, from virtually no dollars to $1 billion\u2014didn\u2019t come until the last of Obama\u2019s eight years in office. Obama didn\u2019t even publicly address the opioid epidemic in front of a live audience until an October 2015 town hall in West Virginia. \nKolodny was among the advocates pressuring the Obama administration to do more, warning Obama that he\u2019d be remembered like Ronald Reagan for failing to acknowledge a public health crisis that unfolded on his watch. In Reagan\u2019s case, that crisis was HIV/AIDS. (And interestingly, it was a celebrity\u2014actor Rock Hudson\u2014who\u2019s credited with helping the Reagan administration make its first tentative steps toward addressing HIV/AIDS issues.)\nBut Kolodny says he\u2019s even more pessimistic about Donald Trump, who, despite making repeated proclamations about the need to solve the opioid epidemic, hasn\u2019t steered new funding to the problem and has even sought to cut resources. POLITICO reported this week on the Trump administration\u2019s plans, for the second straight year, to gut the nation\u2019s drug policy office.\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been very easy for Trump to do better than Obama on opioids,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cBut in terms of action, he\u2019s even worse.\u201d\nBeyond the Oval Office, however, there are signs of change\u2014and not because of celebrity deaths, but because of new pressures on what gets prescribed and when. The first-ever Surgeon General\u2019s report on addiction, released in 2016, devoted hundreds of pages to unpacking the crisis and issued dozens of recommendations, including how physicians could better manage patients\u2019 pain treatment.

Though President Donald Trump and Republican leaders say they will not negotiate on immigration until the government reopens, Democrats are still pushing for a solution on DACA. Here's what you need to know about the program: View As: One Page Slides\n\nWhat is DACA? The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program shields from deportation roughly 690,000 young unauthorized immigrants by providing two-year, renewable permits. DACA was implemented by the Obama administration in 2012, after several attempts to legislate a permanent solution for Dreamers failed in Congress. DACA does not grant immigrants a legal status in the US, but it provides work authorization and defers any immigration enforcement or removal actions they might otherwise be subject to. Applicants to the program were only accepted if they were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012. They also had to have moved to the US before they turned 16 years old, and lived in the US continuously since 2007. They were also required to have graduated high school or obtained a GED, or completed prior military service, and to not have any prior felony or serious misdemeanor convictions. The Trump administration announced September 5 it would wind down the program, calling it an act of executive overreach by the Obama administration and declaring it unconstitutional.\n\nHow is DACA being phased out? The Trump administration gave Congress six months to enact a legislative solution, announcing last September that the program would be terminated on March 5, 2018. The administration allowed those DACA recipients with near-term expiry dates to renew their permits one last time, so long as they applied by October 5, 2017. For a number of reasons, including mail delays, roughly 22,000 DACA recipients who were eligible to renew failed to do so on time, and advocates estimate that 122 immigrants per day have lost their DACA protections since September 5. DACA's phase-out was further complicated in recent weeks by a ruling from a federal judge in California who ordered the Trump administration to resume processing DACA renewal applications. The Trump administration quickly sought to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court and a federal appeals court, but it did not seek a stay on the California judge's initial ruling and will therefore continue processing DACA renewals for the foreseeable future. The uncertainty over DACA's termination date has prompted some lawmakers, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to argue that DACA should be excluded from funding negotiations because the program is not imminently at risk. Immigration lawyers and advocates, however, argue that the uncertainty over DACA renewals only add urgency. Renewals can take months for the government to process, and that leaves both DACA recipients and their employers in limbo. \"It is going to be so detrimental to them, because they just don't know. It's hard for employers to plan,\" Theda Fisher, a partner at the Withers Bergman law firm, told Business Insider. \"[DACA recipients] also all live in a world of uncertainty. So if they have a car loan or a mortgage or a family here, they're not sure if they're going to be able to pay their bills come later this year when their work authorization expires.\"\n\nHow do lawmakers feel about DACA? Lawmakers on all sides of the political spectrum generally agree that DACA recipients were brought to the US through no fault of their own and grew up alongside Americans, and therefore should not face deportation en masse. There are some exceptions, such as Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who has proposed that DACA recipients \"go home\" and that they could volunteer for the Peace Corps in their home countries. King and some far-right immigration commentators argue that granting any type of \"amnesty\" to the DACA population would negatively impact American workers, particularly because DACA recipients are relatively well-educated, skilled, and competitive in the workforce. Economists say there is no evidence DACA recipients are systematically taking jobs away from American workers. But in mainstream politics, the debate is not whether to let DACA recipients stay in the US, but what type of status to grant them. Democrats believe DACA recipients should have a pathway to citizenship, and so should a broader population of unauthorized immigrants brought to the US as children who either fell outside of DACA's age parameters or who may have been eligible for DACA but failed to apply. Some Republicans also support a pathway to citizenship, but hard-line conservatives prefer to grant DACA recipients temporary, renewable permits, as has been suggested in a recent House GOP bill. The lawmakers fear that granting citizenship to DACA recipients would lead to the naturalization of their parents or other relatives, whom they could sponsor.", "title": "Everything you need to know about DACA, the immigration program at the heart of the government shutdown", "sourceId": "business-insider", "sourceName": "Business Insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/when-does-daca-end-what-happens-recipients-2017-9", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T00:30:00Z"}, {"textData": "A hidden, often deadly heart condition with no clear known cause nearly killed 54-year-old Gina Berg two years ago.

After a series of tests, the doctors made a shocking discovery. Parts of her aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body, were so enlarged that it could rupture at any moment. The deadly condition is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and Berg had not one but two of them \u2014 measuring 5 centimeters and 6.5 centimeters wide \u2014 making surgery dangerous.\n\n\u201cIt was a life-and-death situation,\u201d says Berg. \u201cI was not a candidate for open surgery.

The chance of survival when it ruptures is less than 10 percent.\n\nGina Berg on a snorkeling trip. Gina Berg\n\nAccording to the Society for Vascular Surgery, every year, roughly 200,000 Americans are diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms. These aneurysms often grow slowly, without symptoms, but some people may notice a pulsating feeling near the belly button, back pain, or nausea \u2014 often signs of impending rupture.\n\nIf an AAA is found, doctors sometimes use a stent to repair the aorta, but it doesn't always work since the aneurysms are often in places where a stent can\u2019t fit. And even if the stent does fit, patients often undergo a long, painful recovery.\n\nRelated: Heart Attack Risk With Painkillers Starts Within a Week: Study Says\n\nDoctors needed to find a new approach.\n\nA personalized approach pioneered by vascular surgeon and lead researcher, Dr. Gustavo Oderich, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota creates customized stents that are specifically designed for each patient. By using 3-D printing technology, Oderich's team can create an individualized model of the patient's aorta.

The situation is most dire for the nearly 3.7 million who get their insurance through their state's separate CHIP programs, rather than CHIP-funded Medicaid.

Robert Menendez (D-NJ) \u2014 would give a pathway to U.S. citizenship for at least 3.5 million illegal aliens who are eligible and enrolled for DACA, while their parents, who originally brought them to the country illegally, would be allowed to permanently remain in the U.S.\nAdditionally, the expansive amnesty plan would annually give U.S. citizenship to 25,000 foreign nationals who have or previously had Temporary Protected Status (TPS).TPS is a federal program that allows foreign nationals from specific countries that have been devastated, usually by natural disasters, to have a temporary stay in the U.S. until their native\u00a0country is revived. Until the Trump administration, TPS programs for countries like Haiti and El Salvador were regularly extended, with the program becoming a quasi-amnesty for foreign nationals.\nThe Gang of Six amnesty would gradually allow all of those foreign nationals on TPS to permanently stay in the U.S., despite the program never being intended to keep foreign populations in the country.\nSuch a maneuver would mean that the roughly 200,000 El Salvadorans who had their TPS\u00a0terminated\u00a0by the Trump administration would be able to apply for the 25,000 visas allotted in the Gang of Six amnesty plan to try to stay in the U.S. permanently.\nJohn Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.

Inside, the men were denied sleep, forced into stress positions, whipped and beaten. Their officers, particularly Lloyd Bucher, the ship's commander, came in for vicious punishments, as their interrogators demanded they sign \"confessions\" stating they were illegally spying in North Korean territorial waters when they were captured.\n\nLike today, 1968 was a period of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The war that led to the division of the country had only stopped 15 years earlier and bloody skirmishes were still common.\n\nThe crew were terrified of the North Koreans. During one interrogation, after Petty Officer Donald McClarren refused to sign a confession, his guard pulled out a gun, put it to McClarren's head and pulled the trigger. The unloaded weapon clicked, and McClarren passed out.\n\nMock executions like this were routine, as were beatings which seemed like they would never end.\n\nThat night in the forest, as Russell shivered and slipped on the icy ground, he became ever more convinced the end had come.\n\nThe USS Pueblo seen before its capture by North Korea in January 1968.\n\nAlarm\n\nThe seizure of the Pueblo remains one of the most embarrassing incidents in US military history , the first hijacking of a naval vessel since the Civil War, 153 years earlier.\n\nThe incident -- reconstructed here from top secret diplomatic cables; CIA, NSA and State Department reports; and interviews with and testimonies from the crew -- raised tensions in the region to near breaking point. Fifty years on, it remains the closest the world came to a second Korean War, one that cables show US generals were prepared to use nuclear weapons to fight, and could have sucked in both the Soviet Union and China.\n\nThat the Pueblo's seizure did not result in war was the result of months of careful diplomatic negotiations between North Korea and the US, held in near secret at Panmunjom, the so-called \"truce village\" on the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.\n\nAs those negotiations dragged on, the crew of the Pueblo were beaten, tortured, and forced to sign increasingly ludicrous confessions, even as they fretted they would face further punishment on return to the US. If they ever got back.\n\nCapture\n\nIt was a lousy mission from the start.\n\nAfter leaving the Japanese port of Sasebo on January 11, the crew of the Pueblo had to deal with equipment failure, frigid weather that meant ice had to be constantly chipped off instruments, and rough seas. When the crew wasn't vomiting from seasickness, they were bored and listless.\n\nMost had little to do as the spy ship's instruments listened in on North Korean communications from international waters, taking special care not to cross the 19-kilometer (12 mile) maritime border claimed by Pyongyang.\n\nThings finally picked up on January 22, when two North Korean fishing ships circled the Pueblo, their decks packed with people straining for a look at the American ship, some holding binoculars and cameras.\n\nRussell was the ship's cook, he came out from the galley to look at the North Koreans. Going to bed that night, he remembers how he remarked \"that was pretty exciting today,\" only to have a more senior sailor smile and tell him \"just wait until tomorrow.\"\n\nHe was back in the galley preparing dinner when the North Koreans returned, this time in force.\n\nA heavily-armed subchaser circled the Pueblo and hoisted signal flags: \"Heave to, or I will open fire.\"\n\nThe Pueblo responded that it was in international waters as an urgent message was sent warning naval command in the Japanese port of Kamiseya a potential crisis was unfolding.\n\nFour smaller torpedo boats soon joined the subchaser and began circling the Pueblo as two MiG fighter jets flew by overhead. Bucher's ship was hopelessly outgunned, but he was in international waters and he knew other US ships had experienced this type of harassment and escaped unscathed.\n\nAs one of the North Korean ships approached the Pueblo with an armed boarding party on its deck, Bucher ordered the helmsman to head out to open sea at full speed.\n\nRussell was outside the comms room when one of the officers inside, seeing him standing there, ran out and pulled him to the floor, screaming the North Koreans were about to open fire.\n\nAll four torpedo ships raked the Pueblo with machine guns as the subchaser pumped 57mm shells into the Pueblo's forward masts, knocking out its antennas and sending shrapnel spraying across the deck.\n\n\"We need help,\" radio operator Don Bailey told Kamiseya. \"We are holding emergency destruction. We need support. SOS SOS SOS.

The North Korean ship quickly fired two salvos into the Pueblo's upper deck, seriously wounding two sailors.\n\nBucher entered the comms room and dictated a message to Kamiseya: \"Have been requested to follow into Wonsan, have three wounded and one man with leg blown off, have not used any weapons.\"\n\n\"How about some help, these guys mean business,\" he continued. \"Do not intend to offer any resistance.\"\n\nThe USS Pueblo crew seen in a propaganda photo released by their captors after the ship was seized by North Korea.\n\nEmergency\n\nAs the Pueblo was being towed into Wonsan, its crew blindfolded and bound, Washington went into full blown crisis mode. Confusion reigned over why so little reaction had been taken by US forces in the Pacific once they realized the Pueblo was under attack.\n\nTimeline\n\n11 January 1968 Pueblo departs Sasebo, Japan\n\n22 January 1968 Two North Korean fishing boats circle the Pueblo\n\n23 January 1968 Pueblo attacked and captured by North Korea\n\n26 January 1968 President Johnson addresses the nation\n\n2 February 1968 US and North Korean negotiators meet at Panmunjom\n\n4 September 1968 US cable warns Panmunjom negotiations \"at an impasse\"\n\n12 September 1968 North Koreans stage press conference with Pueblo crew\n\n23 December 1968 US signs North Korean-drafted apology\n\nPueblo crew released across the DMZ\n\n24 December 1968 Pueblo crew fly back to the US\n\n\n\nSource: NSA, US State Department, George Washington University\n\n\n\nAs a damning US congressional investigation later found, \"no effort was made by the Navy to launch aircraft from the USS Enterprise,\" a carrier around an hour's flight from the Pueblo, nor was any attempt made to launch jets \"from any of the numerous bases in Japan which were the closest source of possible assistance.\"\n\nWhat planes were scrambled to help were launched from Okinawa, more than 1,400 kilometers (890 miles) away, and they lacked the fuel to make it to the Pueblo in one go. By the time they refueled in South Korea, it was too late.\n\nAs President Lyndon Johnson and his advisers struggled to get on top of things, they advised the government in Seoul \"in strongest terms\" not to attempt any action which could endanger the Pueblo's crew.\n\nThis was a distinct possibility as, days before, North Korean assassins had come within 100 meters of the Blue House, South Korean President Park's official residence. The two countries were still technically at war (as they remain today) and as the Pueblo was being captured, South Korean commandos were busy hunting down and killing the remaining North Korean hit squad.\n\nEven as Washington urged caution in Seoul, the US military was told to prepare for forceful action, and 12 different military solutions were drawn up , including sailing a ship to the same location where the Pueblo was seized in a show of defiance, bombing North Korean bases and airfields, and dropping anti-ship mines into its major ports.\n\nUltimately, Johnson rejected all active military options, choosing instead a \"show of force,\" ordering hundreds of US combat aircraft and an armada of 25 warships, including three aircraft carriers, to South Korea.\n\nAs a top secret cable warned, \"once the US took retaliatory actions involving the use of military force against North Korea ... the chances of obtaining early release of the crew and ship would be virtually eliminated.\"\n\n\"Moreover, retaliation would probably bring the Chinese and Soviets more directly into the situation,\" the memo said , adding \"the risks of an enlargement of the crisis and actual hostilities would be increased.\"\n\nTop secret files recovered from the USS Pueblo seen in a propaganda photo released by North Korea.\n\nHostages\n\nArriving in Wonsan in the aftermath of the initial capture, the Pueblo crew were divided into two groups and, still blindfolded, loaded into vehicles. They were taken to a train station, where a large crowd of people who had gathered yelled anti-American slogans, spit on and hit the crew members. After almost 10 hours on the train, the crew reached Pyongyang and \"the Barn.\"\n\nFrom the moment their ship was boarded onwards, one of the most disturbing things for the crew was the North Koreans \"total and complete hatred\" for the US crewmen.\n\n\"You could just feel it,\" Russell recalled in an interview with CNN. It bewildered the young Americans, many of whom \"had no thoughts about North Koreans one way or another.\"\n\nIt wasn't until much later he learned of US activities during the Korean War: \"We'd bombed the crap out of North Korea, killed over one third of the population. There was no family in North Korea that hadn't lost close relatives because of America.\"\n\nThis hatred \u2014 which previously manifested itself in random violence and cruelty \u2014 made it all the more likely to the crew that their North Korean captors would eventually execute them.\n\nOn that night in the snow, Russell had visions of Nazi mass graves, Poles, Russians and Jews shot and bundled into hastily dug holes by the SS. But after what felt like an eternity of walking, the men came upon a small building. Inside were taps and buckets of water for the men for the men to wash themselves with.\n\nThe North Koreans had no intention of killing their hostages: the seizure of the Pueblo had been a major propaganda victory for Pyongyang, and forcing the US to grovel to get its men back would make it even better. The crew was moved to another location \u2014 \"the Farm\" \u2014 where things got marginally better. They were told they would be kept there until the US apologized.\n\nThe crew thought this was impossible, but unbeknownst to them, after months of futile negotiations at Panmunjom, Johnson's administration was preparing to do just that.\n\nThe iconic blue huts in Panmunjom, on the DMZ between North and South Korea, seen in 1965.\n\nNegotiations\n\nFollowing the end of the Korean War in 1953, a four-kilometer (2.5 mile) wide, highly fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) was set up between the two countries. In the center, sits the Panmunjom Joint Security Area, where South and North Korean soldiers stand watch meters away from each other.\n\nAlmost 65 years since the end of the war, the situation remains basically unchanged\n\nBlue huts straddle the border, and it was here that negotiations began on February 2, 1968 . Early meetings were dominated by North Korean demands for an official apology and American insistences the Pueblo was in international waters and had done nothing wrong. Progress was slow but businesslike, with North Korean Maj. Gen. Pak Chung Kuk often reading from a stack of statements apparently prepared for any potential US gambit.\n\nThe negotiations stretched on for weeks and then months, as the crew of the Pueblo were tortured and hawks in both Washington and Seoul urged military action. Tensions reached such a height that during this period, Adm. Ulysses Sharp, commander in chief of all US forces in the Pacific, drafted a top secret plan to defend South Korea against a possible second invasion by the North.\n\nIn one scenario, dubbed \"Freedom Drop,\" US planes or ground forces would hit attacking North Korean troops and tanks with nuclear explosives while nuclear-tipped missiles with yields of up to 70 kilotons, more than triple that of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, would strike key targets inside North Korea.\n\nThe USS Pueblo seen in Pyongyang, North Korea, on April 16, 2001.\n\nCIA report around this time concluded that, while North Korean guerrilla and cross-border activity had increased dramatically and was continuing, Pyongyang did not intend to invade or risk a full-scale war. However, the CIA warned South Korea's President was becoming increasingly frustrated with both Pyongyang and Washington, and the risk of him, not the US, ordering a \"large-scale retaliation\" was increasing.\n\nThe unpredictability of the South Koreans throughout this process was shown in June 1968, when North Korean forces attacked and sank a covert South Korean reconnaissance boat. Seoul's disastrous spying mission was planned and executed without the knowledge of US Army Gen. Charles Bonesteel, who, as commander in chief of United Nations forces in South Korea, was nominally in charge of the country's navy. In a cable to Washington, Bonesteel warned the South Korean spy mission could have jeopardized the Pueblo negotiations. The mission, Bonesteel said, \"fed Communist propaganda which aims to prove to the world that UNC and ROKS are the provocative aggressors.\"\n\nBy September 1968, negotiations at Panmunjom had reached \"an impasse,\" according to a declassified White House memo.\n\nEventually, following a press conference staged by the North Koreans with the crew of the Pueblo, which ended with Bucher calling on the US government \"to do something to save the lives of these young men,\" Washington agreed to sign an apology as Pyongyang demanded, provided it be allowed to issue a statement beforehand.\n\nThe document , presented by Pak to negotiator US Army Maj. Gen. Gilbert Woodward, was addressed to the \"Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,\" a term never used before by the US, which did not recognize Pyongyang's legitimacy, and said the Pueblo \"illegally intruded into the territorial waters of the DPRK ... and conducted espionage activities of spying out important military and state secrets.\"\n\nFreedom\n\nEven as negotiations were reaching a breakthrough, the men of the Pueblo came close to dooming themselves.\n\nOne night, after being shown two North Korean propaganda films in which Westerners were seen raising their middle fingers to the camera, the crew realized their captors didn't know what the insulting gesture meant, and started flipping them off at every opportunity, including in staged photos and films.\n\nWhen the North Koreans realized what they were doing -- thanks to US media reports on the protest -- they were enraged. As a lawsuit brought by some of the crew against the North Korean government recounted, their captors \"began a campaign of beatings, harassment, and interrogations so intense and concentrated that the hostages referred to it as 'Hell Week'.\"\n\nThe USS Pueblo crew display their middle fingers in propaganda photos put out by their captors.\n\n\"They were subjected to cold temperatures, open doors, constant surveillance, lights on at night, sleep deprivation, and a more rigid enforcement of all rules,\" the lawsuit said. \"They were required to sit in a chair at all times with their heads bowed unless they had specific permission to do otherwise.\"\n\nThen, suddenly, everything changed again. The men were given new clothes and told they were about to be released. The US had agreed to apologize.\n\nOn December 23, 1968, at 9 a.m. Seoul time, Pak and Woodward met for the last time. Woodward read out a short statement denouncing the document he was about to sign and saying he only did so to free the men of the Pueblo. Then he signed it.\n\nOn the North Korean side of the border, the crew were sitting in two buses, wearing new clothes given them that morning. The temperature was frigid, and the moisture from their breath turned to ice on the windows as they waited for several hours.\n\nThe USS Pueblo crew cross the Bridge of No Return between North and South Korea, after their release into US custody on December 23, 1968.\n\nEventually, at 11:30 a.m., the men crossed the \"Bridge of No Return,\" which spanned the DMZ. They came in single file, led by Bucher, who was followed by two crew members carrying the body of Duane Hodges, who had died as a result of a wound sustained during the attack on the Pueblo.\n\nAs he crossed into South Korea, Russell thought \"this is the greatest day of my life,\" but his face, like those around him, was largely devoid of emotion, his spirit \"beaten down so far, and trying to come back up.\"\n\nIt was 11 months to the day since the Pueblo was captured.\n\nOnce in South Korea, the men were led to an army base and ate \"one of the finest meals\" they'd ever had: coffee, orange juice, ham sandwiches, and chicken soup. They were helicoptered to a base near Seoul for medical check ups before finally, on December 24, flying back to the US and their families, just in time for Christmas.\n\nThe USS Pueblo itself was never released. It is still an officially commissioned US Navy ship , one of the oldest in the US fleet. Since 2013, it has been used as a tourist attraction and propaganda museum in Pyongyang.\n\nThe USS Pueblo crew greet relatives upon returning from captivity in North Korea.\n\nWar\n\nMultiple top secret US cables and reports testify to how close the Pueblo crisis brought the Korean Peninsula to a second war.\n\nIn the 13 months prior to the Pueblo incident, there were 610 violations of the armistice agreement by North Korean troops, 200 of whom were killed while the wrong side of the DMZ. At the same time, North Korea repeatedly complained of \"infiltrating naval craft and armed espionage vessels\" along its coast, threatening retaliation.\n\n\"Any idiot could tell things were escalating,\" Russell told CNN recently. Things only got worse following the Blue House incident, of which the crew of the Pueblo were never informed.\n\n\"They should have told us to get the hell out of there, and they didn't,\" Russell said.\n\nA scathing report by the Congressional Committee on Armed Services largely agreed, criticizing the planning of the mission, the lack of support or protection for the Pueblo, and the \"absent or sluggish response by military commanders\" once the crisis got underway.\n\n\"The Navy had no contingency plans whatsoever to provide for going to the rescue of the USS Pueblo in an emergency,\" the report said.\n\nNoth Korean leader Kim Jong Un salutes as he walks in front of the USS Pueblo in Pyongyang on July 27, 2013.\n\nThe history of the Korean Peninsula since the war which split it is littered with incidents like the Pueblo, though the ship's seizure was by far the worst. At times of the greatest tensions, communication has been cut off between Pyongyang and Seoul and Washington, leaving all parties to guess at what the other's intentions are.\n\nA repeat of the Pueblo incident today would be even riskier, with North Korea possessing a nuclear arsenal Kim Il Sung could have only dreamed off, and pressure building in Washington to take pre-emptive military action against it.\n\nUltimately, what avoided war in 1968 could be what avoids it today: sitting down and talking. This month, North and South Korea did just that, reopening communication lines for the first time in more than two years.", "title": "How the seizure of a US spy ship by North Korea nearly sparked nuclear war", "sourceId": "cnn", "sourceName": "CNN", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/20/asia/north-korea-uss-pueblo-intl/index.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T00:07:03Z"}, {"textData": "Washington (CNN) Sen.

But reports by OCE must be publicly released after a certain amount of time has passed, unless the Ethics Committee decides to open an investigation of its own. The OCE report, however, would still have to be publicly disclosed at the end of an investigation.\nThe bipartisan overhaul of Capitol Hill\u2019s sexual harassment policies came after multiple male lawmakers were accused of sexual harassment.

But the OCE had previously reviewed Greene\u2019s claims and concluded in 2015 that there was not substantial reason to believe Farenthold sexually harassed Greene.\nAccording to a GOP aide familiar with the crafting of the legislation, Farenthold\u2019s case led to the provision concerning OCE. Greene\u2019s legal counsel had said that the OCE investigation \u201cunduly harmed\u201d Greene\u2019s case in litigation, which led the House Administration Committee to include the provision in the bill.\nSpeier called the OCE \u201ca dead letterbox for complaints.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for the House Administration Committee said that limiting investigations to the Ethics Committee would streamline the process.\n\u201cThe provision ensures that only one entity is conducting the investigation to make certain there is an accurate gathering of facts and a swift reporting of those findings,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\nBut McGehee warned that the provision bore a resemblance to the effort by House Republicans a year ago to weaken the OCE by putting it under the oversight of the House Ethics Committee.

One year ago, she helped organize a caravan of buses from the Hudson Valley region to Washington for the inaugural Women's March\n\nBack then, she said she was sad, angry and still in shock over US President Donald Trump's election. Going into this year's march, however, she said she feels more hopeful than she did in 2017, despite the tumult of Trump's first year in office.\n\n\"People are paying attention now in a way they haven't before,\" she said. \"There's only good things that can come from that.\"\n\nO'Meara has seen it in her community. After the DC march, another Hudson Valley demonstrator decided to run for office in O'Meara's hometown, and won. Now deputy mayor of the village of New Paltz, K.T. Tobin said she shared O'Meara's hope even as the administration continues to disgust her. That's why Tobin going to march again this year, to continue building momentum, she said.\n\n\"The need is even more urgent.\"\n\nAs the train left Poughkeepsie, organizers passed out leaflets with chants while others put the finishing touches on signs. Outside the window, frozen chunks of the Hudson River flew by.\n\nFor many, it was their second Women's March, but not so for Ellen Marx. Trump's election was too \"demoralizing\" to get her off her feet last year, despite a lifelong activist streak.\n\nAs a college student in the 1960s, she protested the Vietnam War. Then, in the 1970s, she fought for the passage of the Equal Rights Act. In the 1980s, Iran-Contra was her issue.\n\n\"Those were single-issue times,\" said Marx, 64. \"This is all-encompassing.\"\n\nShe might have sat out this year's march if not for her child sitting across the aisle. Moss Sherman, 19, identifies as gender-neutral and goes by the pronouns they and them. Just the other day, Sherman said someone on the street shouted \"queer\" at them in a derogatory manner. The memory of it brings tears to Sherman's eyes.\n\n\"Trump has brought so much fear to so many people,\" Sherman said. \"I just want my identity to feel supported.\"\n\nUnlike other protest signs bearing strident messages, Sherman said they chose a personal message to encourage empathy for all.\n\n\"I am hurting and I know you are, too,\" it read. \"Our struggles may differ but I love you and support you endlessly. Together we may overcome!\"\n\nIn the background, as the train pulled out of Peekskill, O'Meara broke into the classic protest chant, \"This land is your land.\" She clapped and clapped, and others joined her.\n\nFrom the seat behind Sherman, Merrill Sunderland leaned forward. She acknowledged that the group she belonged to, League of Women Voters, struggled to be more inclusive of people like Sherman, in part because of its name.\n\n\"We need to make clear this is not just a women's movement,\" she said. \"This is a movement for anyone's who's suffering under this administration.\"\n\nIn a folder in her lap, she held a pile of reproductions of a League of Women voting poster from 1907. Her reasons for marching this year are the same, she said -- as a Unitarian Universalist, activism and social justice are part of her world view. On a personal level, the camaraderie of a march fortifies; it helps her deal with \"the strain of living in an uncertain political climate,\" she said.\n\nSunderland joined the crowd in song as it switched to another mainstay modified for today's event.\n\nThis little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine\n\nAt the women's march, I'm gonna let it shine...\n\nAt the Tarrytown stop, the car swelled with more adults carrying signs and a handful of children with rainbow hair.\n\nBuoyed by the growing crowds, O'Meara belted out an improvised call-and-response at the top of her lungs:\n\n\"Look out New York... we're coming to town!\"\n\nThe Hudson Valley peace train to #WomensMarch2018 NYC was bumping by the time it reached Tarrytown.

One of them, Patricia Colella, said her reasons for marching were the same as last year but had grown more urgent in light of the spate of mass shootings that dominated 2017, she said.\n\nAs crowds filled the aisles, the conductor came through and asked them to move to another car. By then, the other cars had filled and there was nowhere for them to go.\n\nAs the train pulled into Grand Central Station, O'Meara issued one more call-and-response in honor of Rep. Maxine Waters, who immortalized the phrase last year:\n\nReclaiming our time!\n\nThe peace train members made their way through the terminal and out to 42nd Street. They walked toward Sixth Avenue for a preview of the march route, still waving their signs and chanting. Outside the train their ranks seemed thinner as they mixed with pedestrians near Bryant Park. Some stopped to take pictures of their signs while others impatiently pushed past them.\n\n\"This feels different from last DC,\" O'Meara noted. \"Last year, the crowds stretched for miles. Here it's like business as usual.\"\n\nThe mood shifted yet again as they approached Central Park, where a pre-march rally had begun. Janelle Peotter, a member of Tin Horn Uprising, the brass band from Hudson Valley, raised her sign for a photo op: \"Well behaved women rarely make history.\"\n\nPeotter, 58, has a daughter who lives in Hawaii.

The state\u2019s biggest city approved about two dozen business for legal \"adult\" sales on Jan. 13, but they still awaited a final stamp of approval from the state.

Eric Greitens said Saturday that there was \"no blackmail\" and \"no threat of violence\" by him in what he described as a months-long \"consensual relationship\" with his former hairdresser.\n\nHis attorney, Jim Bennett, told CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV there there is \"zero truth\" to rumors of Greitens' resignation.\n\n\"There is zero truth to any suggestion that Governor Greitens is resigning,\" Bennett said Friday morning. \"He is at work today and will continue to serve as governor.\"\n\nGreitens, 43, has remained out of the public eye since shortly after delivering his State of the State address on Jan. 10. Later that night, KMOV reported that Greitens had an extramarital affair in 2015 as he was preparing to run for governor.\n\nThe report included an audio recording of a conversation between a woman and her then-husband -- recorded secretly by the husband -- in which the woman said Greitens had bound her hands and blindfolded her, taken a photo of her partially nude and warned her to remain silent during an encounter in his St. Louis home.\n\nJeff Roberson / AP\n\nGreitens did not directly say \"yes\" or \"no\" when asked Saturday if he had bound and blindfolded and taken a photo of the woman. But he firmly denied that he had attempted to coerce the woman, or that he or anyone associated with him had paid her to be silent.\n\n\"This was a consensual relationship,\" Greitens said. \"There was no blackmail, there was no violence, there was no threat of violence, there was no threat of blackmail, there was no threat of using a photograph for blackmail. All of those things are false.\"\n\nGreitens added: \"The mistake that I made was that I was engaged in a consensual relationship with a woman who was not my wife. That is a mistake for which I am very sorry.\"\n\nThe AP has not identified the woman because she has not agreed to an interview. The governor said he has had no other romantic or sexual relationships with anyone else while he's been married.\n\n\"I made a mistake with one woman,\" he said.\n\nA former Navy SEAL officer, Rhodes Scholar, author and founder of a veterans' charity, Greitens took his first step into politics by opening an exploratory committee for governor in February 2015. The extramarital relationship started around that March and ended that fall, Greitens said without being more specific. He officially announced he was running for governor in September 2015. He told the AP he discussed and resolved the affair with his wife that same year.\n\nGreitens emerged the winner in a crowded and expensive GOP primary before defeating the state's attorney general, Democrat Chris Koster, in November 2016 to give Republicans control of the governor's mansion for the first time in eight years.\n\nAfter news of the affair broke this month, an attorney for the ex-husband said his client told him that Greitens had slapped the woman, and St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner said she was opening a criminal investigation into the various claims about Greitens' actions.\n\nAsked Saturday if he had ever slapped the woman, Greitens responded: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nHe said he hasn't been contacted by the circuit attorney's office and that neither he nor his attorneys have been contacted by the FBI \"on this or any other matter.\"\n\n\"As far as my conduct, there is nothing to investigate,\" Greitens said.\n\nOn Friday, CNN cited sources while reporting that the FBI had recently opened an inquiry into Greitens. CNN reported that 22-year-old Eli Karabell -- who said he had volunteered to help with Greitens' transition in December 2016 -- approached the news organization to say he had been interviewed by the FBI last November, though he did not offer specifics about what he told agents.\n\nGreitens told the AP he doesn't know Karabell.\n\nGreitens' spokeman Parker Briden said Karabell was a \"serial liar\" who had called Briden multiple times \"acting crazy,\" including claiming he would donate millions to the governor if he could meet with him.\n\nAmid the controversy over his affair, Greitens postponed a scheduled statewide promotional tour this past week for what he had billed in his State of the State address as \"the boldest state tax reform in America.\" Instead, Greitens said he has called almost every state lawmaker and also posted a Facebook apology. Greitens said the \"love and support has been tremendous from people all over the state.\"\n\nBefore becoming governor, Greitens wrote a book entitled \"Resilience,\" which was a collection of letters to a former Navy SEAL friend about overcoming adversity. Greitens now finds himself in a similar position, and he said he recently received a call from that friend encouraging him to hang in there.\n\n\"I'm very confident that God has a way of bringing good from difficulty. God has a way of helping people in the midst of pain to emerge with wisdom,\" Greitens said. \"God has a way of helping you to move through suffering and actually become stronger.\"", "title": "Missouri Gov.

But Senate Democrats believe none of it is too high a price to pay for appeasing their political base.\u201d\n\nWhile Ryan invoked the importance of the military to persuade his colleagues to end the shutdown, a lapse in funding would not actually shut down the military, as it is considered an essential function of the federal government.\n\nConcern for CHIP is also not directly tied to the current shutdown. For the last few years, the expiration date for CHIP funding was September 30, 2017. The renewal of funding for CHIP, which covers medical treatment for children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford other health care coverage, was stalled months ago, when lawmakers disagreed how to fund the program. A short-term solution gave lawmakers a few more months to work out a bipartisan deal, but the deadline for that compromise was separate from the deadline that caused the shutdown. Some states will run out of funding for CHIP by the end of the month without an agreed-upon extension.\n\nRyan propped up both the troops and CHIP beneficiaries as top reasons to condemn Democrats for the shutdown. This shutdown is the first time that federal operations have ceased when one party controls the Senate, House, and the White House.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, placed the blame on Republicans, pointing to the fact that they are the majority in both the House and Senate to avoid accusations of simply being obstructionists.\n\n\u201cWe do some crazy things in Washington, but this is utter madness,\u201d said Ryan.", "title": "Paul Ryan Blames Government Shutdown on Democrats, Accuses Them of Holding Nation 'Hostage'", "sourceId": "newsweek", "sourceName": "Newsweek", "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/government-shutdown-paul-ryan-blame-democrats-786197", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T23:07:48Z"}, {"textData": "Anthony Noto, Twitter's COO, is in negotiations to take the top job at online lender Social Finance, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC on Saturday, ending SoFi's search for a new chief executive that was prompted by a sexual harassment lawsuit.\n\nAn offer has been extended, although terms haven't yet been solidified or a final decision made, according to this source.

The demonstrations are taking place on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration and the 2017 Women's March, in which millions of people were believed to have protested simultaneously for women's rights and against Trump's election victory. Here are some scenes from Saturday's protests: View As: One Page Slides\n\nWomen, men, and children took to the streets in New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and various other cities.\n\nThere were also solidarity protests in countries like Italy, Japan, Germany, and Uganda.

Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday that he discovered Friday that it fell to him to shut down the government \u2013 \u201cwhich is kind of cool.\u201d\nWelcome to the whatever shutdown. \nThe attitude permeating the Trump administration reflects, to some degree, the confidence that comes from finding that the world keeps spinning every time they do something they\u2019ve been warned would have dire consequences, like withdrawing from the Paris climate accords or announcing plans to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. \nAccording to a half-dozen White House officials and outside advisers, Trump is viewing the shutdown through a similar lens, a view encouraged by White House aides, including senior adviser Stephen Miller and congressional liaison Marc Short, who urged him on Friday not to give in to Democratic demands, particularly on immigration. \nSeveral presidential advisers expressed confidence that Democrats, who offered no philosophical objections to the 30-day continuing resolution approved by House Republicans, wanted to make a statement but don\u2019t want to hurt federal workers, tens of thousands of whom will be staying home from work without pay if government funding isn\u2019t restored by Monday morning.\nTwo presidential aides said they expect the current crisis to be resolved by the end of the weekend. \nBut Democrats themselves are sending a different message, at least publicly \u2013 giving no indication they are ready to buckle to pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said of the shutdown\u2019s impact on federal workers. \u201cBut I was just at the women\u2019s march this morning and there are a lot of federal workers there and\u2026they were basically: \u2018You need to stand up to this guy.\u2019\u201d\nOne House Democrat said he was relieved his party had finally \u201cgrown a spine.\u201d \nSign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\nBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\nThe White House has responded by shrugging it off, hewing to a consistent message: This shutdown won\u2019t hurt as much as the one President Barack Obama oversaw five years ago. \nMulvaney drew the comparison repeatedly on Saturday, telling reporters that national parks and monuments would remain open, though they were closed in 2013; that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to protect Americans for this year\u2019s flu outbreak; and that, in another departure from five years ago, the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency would continue uninterrupted.\nHe also argued that Democrats today are being more unreasonable than were Republicans in 2013. \u201cWe were asked to vote for something in 2013 that we did not approve of,\u201d said Mulvaney, who, as a South Carolina congressman, supported the 2013 shutdown because the government-funding bill required lawmakers to approve funding for Obamacare, a federal program to which they vehemently objected.\nOther West Wing aides were playing it cool as well. \n\nPolitics\n\n            By POLITICO STAFF\n\u201cThis seems so banal compared to 2013, when the two sides were actually fired up and there was a cause,\u201d said a senior presidential aide. The 2013 shutdown, precipitated by Republican attempts to prevent funds from flowing to the Affordable Care Act, lasted 17 days. \u201cEverybody figures this is going to resolve itself by the end of the weekend,\u201d the aide said.\n\u201cIt will be nothing compared to Obama\u2019s shutdown,\u201d said another senior White House official, though the 2013 shutdown was roundly blamed on Republicans.\nTrump himself, who has yet to appear in public since the shutdown early Saturday morning, is sticking with the message that Democrats will take most of the heat, though he privately joked to staff that he knows he\u2019ll get blamed\u2014because he always does. \nThough he hasn\u2019t appeared before the cameras, he was active on Twitter throughout the day on Saturday, writing: \u201cThis is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown.\u201d \nIn photos released late Saturday by the White House, Trump and top staff appeared relaxed and smiling.\n\n                            Joyce N. Boghosian/Official White House photo\nWhite House aides said that they think Trump\u2019s Twitter microphone is enough, and they don\u2019t believe the president needs to make official remarks to bring the shutdown to a close.\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s own erratic behavior in negotiations last week\u2014including his remarks to lawmakers that many immigrants come from \u201cshithole\u201d countries\u2014helped precipitate the breakdown in spending talks on the Hill by hardening the positions among party rank-and-file on both sides and giving Democrats a ready-made excuse to walk away from the negotiating table on immigration. \nSince then, he\u2019s been a bit player in the shutdown drama \u2013 the absence of his direction and leadership driving events more than its presence.\nThe irony is that while many had high hopes that Trump\u2019s election augured a new era of bipartisanship in the country, the government shutdown is the clearest evidence yet that hasn\u2019t materialized.\nInstead, a year into his first term, the president \u2013 who won the election railing against the political system \u2013 finds himself trapped inside it, waiting for the political leaders he holds in contempt to set him free. \nAnnie Karni and Seung Min Kim contributed to reporting. \n\n                                            By Janine di Giovanni\n\n                                            By Dan Diamond\n\n                                            By Jeff Greenfield\n\n                                            By Gordon F.

It will also disrupt some federally supported health services, experts said Friday.\n\nIn all, the Department of Health and Human Services will send home \u2014 or furlough \u2014 about half of its employees, or nearly 41,000 people, according to an HHS shutdown contingency plan released Friday.\n\nHere are some federal services and programs consumers might be wondering about:\n\nA pharmacist administers a flu vaccination at a pharmacy in Los Angeles, California, on Jan. 19, 2018. John G. Mabanglo / EPA\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nAccording to the HHS plan, the CDC will suspend its flu-tracking program. That\u2019s bad timing, given the country is at the height of a particularly bad flu season, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Without the CDC\u2019s updates, doctors could have a harder time diagnosing and treating patients quickly, he said.\n\nAlthough states will still track flu cases, \u201cthey won\u2019t be able to call CDC to verify samples or seek their expertise,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Frieden, who was the director of the agency during the 2013 government shutdown.\n\nA government shutdown will also affect the CDC\u2019s involvement in key decisions about next year\u2019s flu vaccine, which are scheduled to be made in coming weeks, said Dr. Arnold Monto, a professor of global public health at the University of Michigan.\n\nRelated: Congress, pointing fingers amid shutdown stalemate, returns to work\n\nBeyond the flu, the CDC will provide only \u201cminimal support\u201d to programs that investigate infectious-disease outbreaks. The Atlanta-based agency\u2019s ability to test suspicious pathogens and maintain its 24-hour emergency operations center will be \u201csignificantly reduced,\u201d according to the plan.\n\nThat could prevent the CDC from identifying clusters of symptoms and disease \u201cthat are the earliest indicators of outbreaks,\u201d Frieden said.\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nAlthough the NIH will continue to treat patients at its clinical center in Bethesda, Md., the agency will not enroll new patients in clinical trials \u2014 which many people with life-threatening illnesses see as their last hope.\n\nMedicare\n\nBeneficiaries will be largely unaffected by a shutdown, especially if it is short. Patients will continue to receive their insurance coverage, and Medicare will continue to process reimbursement payments to medical providers. But those checks could be delayed if the shutdown is prolonged.\n\nMedicaid\n\nStates already have their funding for Medicaid through the second quarter, so no shortfall in coverage for enrollees or payments to providers is expected. Enrolling new Medicaid applicants is a state function, so that process should not be affected.\n\nStates also handle much of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides coverage for lower-income children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. But federal funding for CHIP is running dry \u2014 its regular authorization expired on Oct. 1, and Congress has not agreed on a long-term funding solution. Federal officials announced Friday that the staff necessary to make payments to states running low on funds will continue to work during a shutdown.\n\nCommunity health centers\n\nAccording to the HHS plan, the Health Resources and Services Administration will continue to operate the nation\u2019s 1,400 community health centers \u2014 clinics that serve about 27 million low-income people, providing preventive care, dentistry and other basic services. It will also continue the Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which targets low-income and at-risk families with house calls and lessons for healthy parenting. That program served about 160,000 families in fiscal year 2016.\n\nBut even those programs may not be at full speed. Funding for community health centers and the home visiting program was not renewed last fall \u2014 a casualty of Congress\u2019 fight over the CHIP reauthorization \u2014 so, they are operating on left-over funds.\n\nRelated: Government shutdown 2018: What\u2019s open and what\u2019s closed?\n\nACA premium subsidies\n\nThe shutdown will not affect some of the most politically charged health care programs, including ones created by the Affordable Care Act. Subsidies for people who get their health insurance through healthcare.gov or state marketplaces will not be affected, according to HHS.\n\nVeterans Affairs\n\nStaffing for the Department of Veterans Affairs will remain largely intact. \u201cEven in the event that there is a shutdown, 95.5 percent of VA employees would come to work, and most aspects of VA\u2019s operations would not be impacted,\u201d said department press secretary Curtis Cashour in an email.\n\nMore than 99 percent of employees of the Veterans Health Administration, which runs the health care system, will continue working, according to the department\u2019s contingency plan.\n\nHowever, the Veterans Benefits Administration, responsible for overseeing benefits such as life insurance and disability checks, will face larger cutbacks. Over a third of its employees face furlough under a government shutdown.\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nIn the short term, the crucial activities that protect consumers will get done, said Jill Hartzler Warner, who was the associate commissioner for special medical programs at the FDA during the 2013 shutdown.\n\nPrograms that are critical for the public safety will continue, as will positions paid for by user fees, including work under the Center for Tobacco Products, according to the HHS plan.\n\nThe hundreds of staff members who conduct sample analysis and review entry of products into the U.S. will continue to work. However, routine inspections and laboratory research will cease.\n\nWarner, who left the agency in March 2017 and now works as an industry consultant, said grants for rare-disease drug development were determined in 2013 to not be necessary and were postponed.\n\nNutrition services for seniors\n\nThe Administration for Community Living will not be able to fund federal senior nutrition programs during any shutdown, according to HHS officials. But it was not immediately clear how quickly clients would be affected.\n\nA shutdown could delay federal reimbursements to independent Meals on Wheels programs, which serve more than 2.4 million seniors nationwide, according to Colleen Psomas, a spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels America. That could force programs to expand waiting lists for meals, reduce meals or delivery days, or suspend service, she said.\n\nThe magnitude of the effect could vary by the length of the shutdown and any final allocation. Some programs, however, could weather a shutdown, staffers said. In Portland, Ore., Meals on Wheel People spokeswoman Julie Piper Finley said meal delivery there will not be suspended. That agency receives about 35 percent of its funding through the Older Americans Act, but raises the rest of the money, ensuring that services are not disrupted.\n\nMeanwhile, services connected to food and nutrition services for other needy populations are likely to keep operating with state partners who have funding through February and, in some cases, March, according to a Department of Agriculture spokesperson. Those programs include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Child Nutrition Programs and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.\n\nFood safety\n\nThe FDA\u2019s food safety programs will cease, according to the HHS plan, but inspections conducted by Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) will continue.\n\nMeat and poultry inspections are \u201csuch a critical, essential task, and the meat and poultry inspection acts require that inspectors be present continuously,\u201d otherwise processing plants would have to close, said Brian Ronholm, former head of FSIS who now works for the law firm Arent Fox.\n\nRonholm added that many FSIS employees are \u201ccareer folks\u201d who have worked there through previous government shutdowns. \u201cThere was a lot of built-in knowledge of how to function during the [2013] shutdown,\u201d he said, adding that this expertise would help the agency if there is another shutdown.", "title": "How the government shutdown might affect your health - NBCNews.com", "sourceId": "nbc-news", "sourceName": "NBC News", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/how-government-shutdown-might-affect-your-health-n839516", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T22:44:00Z"}, {"textData": "This site uses cookies to enhance your reading experience.

The scene highlighted the high political stakes for both parties in an election-year shutdown whose consequences were far from clear.\n\n\"The American people cannot begin to understand why the Senate Democratic leader thinks the entire government should be shut down until he gets his way on illegal immigration,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., hours after a last-chance Senate vote failed.\n\nDemocrats refused to provide the votes needed to reopen the government until they strike a deal with President Donald Trump protecting young immigrants from deportation, providing disaster relief and boosting spending for opioid treatment and other domestic programs.\n\nDemocrats feel \"very, very strongly about the issues\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, adding that he believes \"the American people are on our side.\"\n\nThe fighting followed a late-night vote in which Senate Democrats blocked a House-passed measure that would have kept agencies functioning for four weeks.\n\nRepublicans began the day hopeful they might pick off Democratic support for a three-week version and bring the episode to a quick end. Democrats are insisting on an alternative lasting only several days \u2014 which they think would pressure Republicans to cut an immigration deal \u2014 and say they'll kill the three-week version when the Senate votes on it by early Monday.\n\nThe shutdown came on the anniversary of Trump's inauguration. As lawmakers bickered in the Capitol, protesters marched outside in a reprise of the women's march from a year ago. The president remained out of sight and canceled plans to travel to his resort in Florida for the weekend. He did tweet, making light of the timing by saying Democrats \"wanted to give me a nice present\" to mark the start of his second year in office.\n\nTrump worked the phones, staying in touch with McConnell, while White House legislative affairs director Marc Short and budget chief Mick Mulvaney met at the Capitol with House Republicans. GOP lawmakers voiced support for the White House stance of not negotiating while the government was shuttered.\n\nTempers were short and theatrics high. Lawmakers bickered over blame, hypocrisy and even the posters brought to the House floor. While neither chamber voted on a measure to open the government, the House did vote on whether a poster displayed by Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne of Alabama violated the House rules on decorum. The House voted to allow the poster, which bore a photo of Schumer and the quote \"the politics of idiocy.\"\n\nWhile Republicans blamed the breakdown on Schumer, Democrats increasingly focused their messaging on criticizing Trump, whose popularity is dismal. Democrats were using his zigzagging stance in immigration talks \u2014 first encouraging deals, then rejecting them \u2014 to underscore his first, chaotic year in office.\n\n\"Negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\" Schumer said.\n\nShort compared Democrats' actions to \"a 2-year-old temper tantrum.\"\n\nRepublicans seemed content to hope additional Democrats will break as pressure builds and the impact of the shutdown becomes clearer.\n\nIn the late-night vote blocking the bill preventing a shutdown, five Democrats from states Trump won in the 2016 election voted to keep government functioning. In a sign that moderates are feeling pressure, more than a dozen centrist senators from both parties have been trying to craft an immigration and spending compromise that party leaders would embrace, but they've fallen short so far.\n\nRepublicans argued that Democrats were blocking extra Pentagon funds by keeping government closed and thwarting a long-term budget deal.\n\n\"I question if Senate Democrats are really united,\" Short told reporters. \"We think there'll be more today and hopefully they'll continue to see that it's not wise to hold our troops hostage.\"\n\nBut pressure on Republicans could mount with the new workweek Monday and the impact of the federal shutdown becomes more apparent to people.\n\nWhile the Statue of Liberty \u2014 the nation's emblem of its immigrant past \u2014 and Philadelphia's Liberty Bell were closed Saturday, visitors had access to other iconic national parks like Yellowstone. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke tweeted a photo of himself talking to students at the World War II Memorial in Washington, blocks from White House.\n\nSocial Security and most other safety-net programs were unaffected by the lapse in federal spending authority. Critical government functions continued, with uniformed service members, health inspectors and law enforcement officers set to work without pay. But if no deal is reached before Monday, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed.\n\nFor leverage, Democrats were banking on Trump's wobbly presidency and the GOP's control of the White House, the House and Senate \u2014 a triumvirate that until now had never allowed a government closure to occur.\n\n\"Republicans in Congress plunged head-first into the Trump shutdown,\" Schumer told reporters. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Republicans \"so incompetent and negligent that they couldn't get it together to keep the government open.\"\n\nWhich party's strategy would succeed remained open to debate.\n\nRetired Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., a veteran of shutdown wars, said he believed Democrats believe \"the more chaos they can create the better.\" He said Schumer's tough strategy was \"a gross overplaying of his hand\" and predicted Democrats would eventually relent.\n\nFormer Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., said both parties needed to be cautious.\n\n\"It's obvious that Democrats are playing to their base and Republicans are playing to their base,\" he said. \"Everybody loses. It just feeds into the fed-up atmosphere of the American people.\"\n\nDemocrats have been seeking a deal to protect so-called Dreamers. Around 700,000 of them have been shielded against deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which Trump halted last year. He's given lawmakers until early March to pass legislation restoring the protections, but he's demanded added money for his proposed border wall with Mexico as a price.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Daly, Richard Lardner and Darlene Superville contributed to this report.", "title": "SHUTDOWN 2018", "sourceId": "associated-press", "sourceName": "Associated Press", "url": "https://apnews.com/e01ae8f8033d46cc98465181503ff036", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T22:37:38Z"}, {"textData": "Former Chief White House Ethics Lawyer Richard Painter reacts to the news that Donald Trump's laywer arranged for a $130,000 payment to the porn star who Trump had an affair with.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}", "title": "Richard Painter on Stormy Daniels: \"The whole thing's disgusting\"", "sourceId": "msnbc", "sourceName": "MSNBC", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/richard-painter-on-stormy-daniels-the-whole-thing-s-disgusting-1141704259648", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T22:35:31Z"}, {"textData": "Story highlights One year after the inauguration of Donald Trump, many have returned to the Women's March, signs in hand.\n\n(CNN) The day after the inauguration of Donald Trump, people across the world took to the streets in protest.

This was at the height of the rush to invade Iraq, and \u201cit was one of the first times where I could kind of see the bullshit,\u201d recalls Windsor, now 33. Windsor used a piece of bark to draw the earth on the ground, with missiles flying around wildly. He and his friends, who Windsor calls nerds, were prone to making fun of a \u201cvaguely Slavic\u201d accent a character in Rounders used; later, when he decided to turn the bark drawings into an animation, it was this accent he latched onto.\n\n\u201cEnd of the World,\u201d the animated video that came out of that night in Tracy, arrived on the then-popular funny-video sites Ebaum\u2019s World and Black Sheep a few months later, after a friend who Windsor said, admittedly dating himself, was into \u201cthe hacker\u201d scene, uploaded it. Initially, he\u2019d made it just to share between friends. Instead, the video became one of the first-ever viral videos. While the total number of views from Ebaum\u2019s World and Albino Blacksheep aren\u2019t known, a version of the video uploaded onto Youtube \u2013 not yet created when \u201cEnd of the World\u201d was made \u2013 has nearly 17 million views today.\n\nFor many of us who came of age into a time when spending time on the internet still felt new, embarrassing, or just weird, the video was one of the first things we shared with other people. Unlike the more surreal artifacts of the forum age, \u201cEnd of the World\u201d was cinematic, funny, and relevant enough to be brought into real world conversations. The video\u2019s jokey portrayal of a president hugging nukes in front of a desk was an iconic political image to a new generation of internet-native activists and voters.\n\nWindsor\u2019s politics were heavily influenced by his music: Anti Flag, Bad Religion, and Rage Against the Machine all helped awaken him to the \u201cbullshit.\u201d And like many people his age, watching the news cover 9/11, and noticing the way the story of the attack and its aftermath were manipulated by different channels, had a prominent effect on him. The push to create something came out of habit. His mother worked on computers for the school system, and he\u2019d been working for her since he was 16, getting to know Adobe software like Flash, After Effects, and Illustrate. At the beginning, he only wanted to make his friends laugh. The end of the world, particularly as a result of man\u2019s stupidity, felt like it would do the trick.\n\n\u201cMy friends and I came from a suburban town,\u201d he explained, \u201cso there\u2019s a little bit of a suburban frustration there I think. I think all of us wanted to kind of get out, you know? There\u2019s not a lot to do in a town like that. So maybe there is kind of a flippant fuck-this attitude [in the video], but I also think that people process stuff that way. When there\u2019s something really scary, we laugh about it. These are real things that are happening to us.\u201d\n\nWindsor himself never achieved the fame that his video did, and although he\u2019s made a career out of similar work \u2014 he\u2019s an art director and animator \u2014 he still isn\u2019t widely known as its creator. But 15 years later, Windsor isn\u2019t sure things have gotten much better. So without any sort of pretense, imagined importance, or even really credit for his past work, he decided to make a sequel to the beloved video. You can watch it here:\n\n\u201cEnd of the World (Probably for Real This Time)\u201d carries the torch into 2018, with a surprising loyalty to the original. While most updates or reboots attempt to shove an old favorite directly into this time period, Windsor\u2019s sequel stays remarkably in line with his first project, updating ever so slightly but staying the same in theme and voice. At the same time, his skills as an animator and storyteller have grown so much that he interjects quite a bit into the four minute video. The results won\u2019t blow your mind or make you say wow or completely destroy this republican politician or break your heart; they\u2019ll just make you feel a little seen, and maybe a little happier. It\u2019s the beginning of the internet revived.\n\n\u201cMaking fun of these very, very real threats to our survival, that are on the one hand not to be taken lightly at all - really that was the instigation to finally make another video associated with the end of the world,\u201d he said of the sequel, which he especially thanks his wife for giving him time to make. \u201cBecause, yeah man, shit\u2019s fucked right now, and it\u2019s only going to be getting worse.\u201d\n\nIt was hostility in public schools, he says, that particularly pushed him to make the sequel. Like many parents, he feels personally responsible to leave \u201csomething\u201d for his two daughters, a nine-year-old and a three-year-old. Windsor, who at 18 saw global warming as a practically destined killer of his home state and planet, wants his children to be able to breathe.\n\nClimate change isn\u2019t the only thing given more room in the sequel. Other nations, previously reduced to beloved caricatures, become more prominent in the new animation. Russia and France take on new roles, but so do immigrants affected by DACA, and people from countries America is no longer comfortable associating with. The sequel remains sharp and funny and at times absurdly crude, but in a time when the president can say just about anything he wants, why would you not portray him in the most disgusting way possible?\n\nAbove all, Windsor hoped to let the sequel exist on its own, free of an overly pushy message. He\u2019s learned from his daughter in particular that heavy-handed lessons often fall on deaf ears, and hopes that his art will nudge more than push. \u201cThe detachment part might be a little bit important because otherwise it can be a little heavy-handed. There\u2019s a certain necessity to just not being too heavy-handed,\u201d he said. \u201cI find this when interacting with my daughter too. I can tell her and say, this is what you need to do and this is how you need do it. But when it really sinks is when she gets to figure it out herself. And I can kind of lead her there, but she\u2019s got to do it herself.

Deport criminals. Stop illegal immigration now,\u201d a voiceover says. \u201cDemocrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants.\u201d \nThe ad shows House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) before cutting to video of an undocumented immigrant on trial for killing two police officers. \nAll three lawmakers are advocates of immigration reform and oppose Trump\u2019s border wall, but they aren\u2019t open borders advocates or defenders of murder; the bills they\u2019ve pushed exempt violent criminals from protections and include border security measures. Schumer even said he offered Trump funding for his wall on Friday, but that the president declined the deal. \nBut calling Democrats \u201ccomplicit\u201d in murder fit in with the White House\u2019s messaging on the government shutdown, which happened when the Senate failed to pass a short-term government funding bill by the end of Friday. Most of the Senate Democratic caucus, plus four Republicans, voted against the bill, many of them saying they would not support funding without a fix for the 700,000 undocumented young people Trump put at risk of deportation by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \nWhile Trump and the White House have occasionally referred to those young people, often called Dreamers, in fairly sympathetic terms,\u00a0they\u2019re now characterizing them as \u201cunlawful immigrants\u201d whom Democrats insist on helping.\nIt\u2019s a return to form for Trump, who launched his campaign by claiming that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals across the border, has called for a U.S.-Mexico border wall and has highlighted crimes committed by people without legal status in the country. \nWhile some undocumented immigrants do commit crimes separate from immigration, numerous studies have disputed the idea that immigrants are bringing more crime into the country. \nTrump and his administration have also repeatedly attacked Democrats for their immigration stances. As part of a campaign against so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d a term for jurisdictions the limit their cooperation with deportation efforts to some degree, the administration has floated the idea of criminally prosecuting local officials. \nTrump\u2019s message from day one has been that immigrants are, first and foremost, a frightening threat. His administration has said it won\u2019t discuss immigration measures until Democrats vote to reopen the government.

It is also a symbol of the Afghan state. Built in the 1970s as part of the Intercontinental Hotels chain, it was seized by the government after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

The Interior Department said attractions like the Grand Canyon and the World War II Memorial on the National Mall would be open to visitors, though the National Park Service will close its offices and no longer provide services like cleaning restrooms, collecting trash and plowing roads.\n\nThe last time Congress failed to agree on a budget, in 2013 during the Obama administration, a group of veterans, aided by Republican lawmakers, knocked over barricades to visit the World War II Memorial. This time, said Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, \u201cthe American public and especially our veterans who come to our nation\u2019s capital will find war memorials and open-air parks open to the public.\u201d\n\nCritics said the decision to keep the parks open smacked of politics. \u201cGates would be open and people could enter, but there would be virtually no staff on hand to protect them or the parks\u2019 resources,\u201d said Theresa Pierno, the president and chief executive of the National Parks Conservation Association. \u201cIt\u2019s an irresponsible way to run parks.\u201d\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution and its National Zoo will also stay open at least through Monday. All told, the Park Service will furlough 21,383 of its 24,681 employees, while the Interior Department will send home more than three-quarters of its 70,000 workers.\n\nVideo\n\nAnother federal institution that will stay open, at least temporarily, is the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency\u2019s administrator, Scott Pruitt, told the staff on Friday that it had a financial cushion that would allow it to operate through next week even if government funding expired. \u201cAll E.P.A. employees should follow their normal work schedule for the week of Jan. 22, 2018,\u201d Mr. Pruitt wrote in a memo. Most of the agency\u2019s nearly 14,500 employees will be furloughed after that money runs out.\n\nSome cabinet members put a spotlight on the damage they said a shutdown would inflict on the public. The education secretary, Betsy DeVos, said, \u201cA protracted delay would severely curtail the cash flow to school districts, colleges and universities and vocational rehabilitation agencies that depend on the department\u2019s funds to support their services.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany school districts, Ms. DeVos wrote, receive 20 percent of their operating funds from the department, while colleges rely on federal funds to pay workers who help retain disadvantaged students. Moreover, the government pays about 80 percent of the cost of providing services to individuals with disabilities who are in vocational programs.\n\nThe Pentagon tried to project an image of business as usual, though the shutdown will curtail training, maintenance and medical facilities. The effects were particularly jarring at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, where hundreds of National Guard soldiers, engineers and civilian contractors had mobilized for a mock armored assault \u2014 an exercise nearly a year in the planning.\n\nAt midnight, with the Senate still in an impasse, the exercise was called off, the soldiers turned in their weapons, and the tanks returned to their motor pools. By late Saturday morning, everyone headed home.\n\nPhoto\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis vowed in a memo to his staff on Friday that he would try to mitigate the effects of the shutdown, both personal and financial. Among those are the loss of $100,000 gratuity benefits to families who lose a service member, as well as government-funded travel to funerals and transfers of the dead at Dover Air Force Base, according to the nonprofit Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. The wars, however, will go on.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to execute daily operations around the world \u2014 ships and submarines will remain at sea, our aircraft will continue to fly and our warfighters will continue to pursue terrorists through the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia,\u201d Mr. Mattis wrote.\n\nAt home, the Postal Service, which has funded its operations since the 1970s by selling stamps and other services, will remain open. The government will continue to cover more than 100 million elderly, disabled or low-income people through Medicare and Medicaid. Entitlement programs are not directly affected by the lapse in appropriations.\n\nThe Trump administration said that federal officials would continue making payments to states for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, using funds that remain unspent from prior months. But funds are running out in many states, and some have notified parents that their children could soon lose coverage if Congress does not act.\n\nLikewise, although the Social Security Administration will furlough more than 10,000 employees, more than 52,000 will stay on to continue paying benefits and performing other essential duties. About 62 million Americans, including retirees and disabled workers, receive Social Security benefits.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cEverybody is concerned about their Social Security check,\u201d Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, said before she went back into negotiations at the Capitol. \u201cAnd 90 percent of Homeland Security will continue, which is important to people in New York.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Maloney noted that the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between the Trump campaign and the Russians would also not be interrupted by the shutdown. Nor will proceedings at federal courts, at least for a few weeks. The courts will remain open and can continue operations through Feb. 9, using court fees and other funds.\n\nMost proceedings will occur as scheduled, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. In cases where a federal lawyer is not working because of the shutdown, hearings may be rescheduled.\n\nFederal officials also promised that there would be no disruption of the school lunch program or food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Food Safety and Inspection Service will continue inspecting meat, poultry and egg products.\n\nWhile roughly half of the work force at the Department of Health and Human Services will be furloughed, the department said it would continue services that involve the safety of human life or the protection of property. Those include a suicide prevention hotline, patient care at the National Institutes of Health, and product recalls and other consumer protection services run by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAt the I.R.S., however, the shutdown will burden an already understaffed agency that is staggering under a crush of questions related to the new tax law. The Treasury Department said 45,479 people, or 56 percent, of the I.R.S.\u2019s staff would be furloughed. Because of budget cuts, the agency has lost some 21,000 employees since 2010.\n\nTony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, warned this past week that a shutdown would stress an already strained tax system, and that it would be the fault of Congress and the Trump administration, not federal workers, if problems arose.\n\nMr. Stier of the Partnership for Public Service said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has thought of the implementation of the tax bill in the context of a shutdown.

Every thought of nuclear annihilation, every glimpse of Mr. Trump\u2019s angry visage, cracks open a door in the fourth dimension. It\u2019s a very small door, however: Lab studies of emotion and time perception are typically limited to durations of a few seconds at most. For that reason these time warps have gone unnoticed; it takes a well-designed experiment to tease them into conscious awareness.\n\nNo doubt all presidents and presidential aspirants induce a similar effect, to a degree. But Mr. Trump\u2019s day-to-day and moment-to-moment public presence, and his effect on our perceptual clocks, is surely unmatched. Perhaps these moments, taken collectively, have been sufficient to alter our perception of the entire year, slowing it down or speeding it up.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump, did 2017 fly by or did it feel interminable? The brain manages time perception differently over long intervals, like hours, days and years, than over short ones. At those longer time scales, the speed at which time seems to pass depends far less on momentary moods than it does on how engaged you are with life. A study done in geriatric homes found that the people who say some version of \u201cTime is speeding by\u201d tended to be more active and happier, whereas those who said time was moving slowly tended to be inactive and depressed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has spurred you into committed political action, the year was perhaps a quick one. That also may be true if you\u2019ve chosen to ignore Mr. Trump and news coverage related to him. But if you\u2019ve been wringing your hands and waiting for it all to be over, the year may have felt very long indeed.\n\nThe science here is pretty simple, even tautological: The main reason that time seems to slow down \u2014 at least on longer, conscious time scales \u2014 is that you\u2019ve been thinking about it. If you\u2019re bored at a dinner party, you\u2019re looking at your watch and thinking about how to speed up the time between now and when you can leave. And later, when you think back on the party, mostly what you\u2019ll remember is how interminable it was, because most of those memories involve wishing that time would speed up.\n\nConversely, when we say, \u201cTime flew by,\u201d typically what we mean is, \u201cI lost track of the time.\u201d Time seems to fly by during that movie or that workday or that year because you are so engaged that you aren\u2019t paying attention to the time, so when the event ends, you are surprised \u2014 \u201cWow, it\u2019s 10 o\u2019clock already?\u201d In effect, the experience of \u201ctime flying by\u201d is an indicator of good mental health: You\u2019re busy, involved, engaged, doing something you enjoy or care about, whether it\u2019s in an office or with friends or raising kids.\n\nNote, however, that although time can sometimes fly past, by definition you won\u2019t notice until it\u2019s over. Time never flies; it only ever has flown.\n\nMany people may be wondering whether the remaining three years of Mr. Trump\u2019s current term of office can be made to speed up. This isn\u2019t physically possible, of course, but it might be psychologically achievable. Remember that time flies when \u2014 and because \u2014 you aren\u2019t paying attention to it.

His aides said he spoke by phone with Republican congressional leaders as well as Defense Secretary James Mattis about the impact of the shutdown.\n\nAs with lawmakers throughout Washington, D.C., the White House aides argued about who will be blamed by voters for the shutdown.\n\nWhile Democrats decry the \"Trump shutdown,\" Mulvaney said he prefers the term \"Schumer shutdown,\" adding: \"It's got that nice little ring to it, doesn't it?\"\n\nTrump had planned to spend the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., but canceled the trip because of the shutdown.\n\nAs lawmakers negotiate, the president's schedule moving forward is subject to change on a day-by-day basis, aides said \u2014 including a planned trip late next week to a global economic conference in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2DyHfje", "title": "Trump aides: No DACA talks until government re-opens", "sourceId": "usa-today", "sourceName": "USA Today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/20/trump-aides-no-daca-talks-until-government-re-opens/1051060001/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:59:37Z"}, {"textData": "Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

Schumer (D-N.Y.) faulted President Trump and Senate Republicans for the government shutdown during a speech on the Senate floor Jan. 20. (U.S. Senate)\n\nIn a remarkable, televised 55-minute meeting with about two dozen Democratic and Republican lawmakers earlier this month, President Trump twice proclaimed that any immigration deal would need to be \u201ca bill of love\u201d \u2014 setting an optimistic tone for averting a government shutdown with a bipartisan solution.\n\nAfter the president ordered cameras out of the Cabinet Room that day, the group delved into the details. Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump\u2019s homeland security secretary, and her staff passed out a four-page document on the administration\u2019s \u201cmust haves\u201d for any immigration bill \u2014 a hard-line list that included $18 billion for Trump\u2019s promised border wall, eliminating the diversity visa lottery program and ending \u201cextended family chain migration,\u201d according to the document, which was obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nBut one person seemed surprised and alarmed by the memo: the president.\n\nWith Democrats and Republicans still in the room, Trump said that the document didn\u2019t represent all of his positions, that he wasn\u2019t familiar with its contents and that he didn\u2019t appreciate being caught off-guard. He instructed the group to disregard the summary and move on, according to one of the lawmakers in the room, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the wedding where someone actually stands up and objects to the wedding,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cIt was that moment.\u201d\n\nThat meeting nearly two weeks ago, and the president\u2019s ambivalence, marked the beginning of yet another period of Trump-fueled tumult that helped push the federal government into a shutdown at midnight Friday. Pinging from one upheaval to the next \u2014 while clearly not understanding the policy nuances of the negotiation \u2014 Trump clashed at different times with Democrats and members of his own party, who grew increasingly exasperated with the president even as they sought to cast blame upon the other side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for something that President Trump supports,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in public frustration at one point late in the negotiations. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not yet indicated what measure he\u2019s willing to sign.\u201d\n\n[In government spending fight, GOP embraces hard-line immigration stance]\n\nTrump is a self-proclaimed dealmaker who has struggled to close critical deals as president \u2014 an unreliable negotiator who seems to promise one thing only to renege days, or even hours, later. He boasts of being \u201cflexible\u201d and has few core ideological convictions, yet often seems torn between his desire for a bipartisan \u201cwin\u201d and the pull of the nationalist populism he ran on. In politics, he resembles at times an amateur jazz musician \u2014 moody and improvisational, but without the technical chops to hold a piece together.\n\nThe early weeks of 2018 have felt eerily similar to those of 2017, as upheaval has consumed the president\u2019s agenda and message \u2014 including the shutdown battle, a tell-all book chronicling a president at sea and news of a payout before the 2016 election to a porn star alleging an affair with Trump.\n\n\u201cNegotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\u201d Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) complained on the Senate floor Saturday, some 12 hours into the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s next to impossible.\u201d\n\nThis account of Trump\u2019s divisive role in shutdown negotiations is based on interviews with more than a dozen lawmakers, White House advisers, government aides and Trump confidants, most of whom requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations.\n\nView Graphic Everything you need to know about a government shutdown\n\nThe talks seemed to begin with promise. Trump loved the positive press he received from the Cabinet Room meeting-turned-reality-show on Jan. 9. He hoped to be the bipartisan dealmaker who could both keep the government open and provide legislative protections for \u201cdreamers,\u201d the nearly690,000 young immigrants facing deportation after Trump announced an end to Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, according to an outside adviser.\n\n\u201cThe construct that always works for the president is saying, \u2018Bush couldn\u2019t get it done, Obama couldn\u2019t get it done, but I can get it done,\u2019 \u201d said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser. \u201cThat is his sweet spot.\u201d\n\nTwo days into the negotiations, on Jan. 11, Trump the negotiator seemed to signal he was ready to deal \u2014 inviting Sens. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) to the White House to present their ideas for a compromise to stave off a shutdown.\n\nBut when Durbin and Graham arrived, they found an angry president, surrounded by hawkish immigration opponents and no longer amenable to the deal he\u2019d praised in phone calls just hours earlier. At one point, Trump dismissed immigrants from African nations as coming from \u201cshithole\u201d countries and wondered why he had to allow them into the United States. He also said he would prefer people from countries such as Norway. The racially charged remarks reported by The Post thrust the president into yet another controversy of his own making and further complicated the shutdown talks.\n\n[Everything you need to know about the government shutdown]\n\nDespite his vocal frustration, Graham continued to try to work with Trump, turning a televised Senate hearing with Nielsen the following week into a personal appeal to the president.\n\n\u201cSo Tuesday, we had a president that I was proud to golf with, call my friend, who understood immigration had to be bipartisan, you had to have border security,\u201d Graham said, referring to the initial Jan. 9 meeting and addressing Nielsen as if speaking directly to Trump. \u201cBut he also understood the idea that we had to do it with compassion.\u201d\n\nGraham flung his arms apart and concluded: \u201cNow I don\u2019t know where that guy went. I want him back.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, viewed Graham\u2019s increasingly public criticisms as disloyal, according to one outside adviser.\n\nWithin Trump\u2019s broader orbit of outside friends and confidants, however, there was growing concern that a shutdown would offer only \u201cdownside for the Republicans,\u201d said another informal adviser who recently spoke with Trump.\n\nThis adviser added that some allies worried Trump was making poor political decisions and would struggle with the optics of a shutdown \u2014 including images of Trump and some of his advisers departing for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this coming week.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 ad: Your government closes, and Trump does a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and half the Cabinet goes to Davos,\u201d the adviser said, referring to a scheduled event at Trump\u2019s private Florida club Saturday night.\n\nAbout a week out from a possible shutdown, Trump, too, was becoming frustrated. He groused that his staff had \u201cfailed him\u201d by not reaching a better compromise on Capitol Hill. Morale among mid-level staff in the West Wing and Eisenhower Executive Office Building had plummeted, said two people familiar with the mood inside the White House.\n\nAs the shutdown loomed, the president grew more erratic. In the first week, he set off a 101-minute scramble after tweeting that Congress should vote against a foreign surveillance bill that his own White House was championing after watching a segment on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d This past Thursday, he did it again \u2014 taking to Twitter to suggest that the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program should not be included in any short-term spending bill. The stance directly contradicted the strategy of congressional Republicans, who were attempting to use CHIP to lure reluctant Democrats into supporting the plan.\n\nA White House official called it \u201cdeja vu.\u201d\n\nThe president, however, did not seem to fully grasp just how problematic his CHIP tweet was for his own party. Minutes after tweeting his criticism, Trump spoke by phone with McConnell, according to people familiar with the conversation. Trump praised the Republican bill, showed no reluctance when McConnell explained his plan to forge ahead with it and made no mention of his tweet, these people said. Trump also reassured House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) that he liked the bill as it was.\n\nThe whole episode left congressional leaders puzzled: Why, they wondered, would the president tweet something negative about their legislation and rattle Republican lawmakers without ever raising concerns with them \u2014 and then act as if nothing had happened?\n\nSen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), speaking to reporters Friday night about his general frustrations with the process, said that \u201cour country was founded by geniuses, but it\u2019s being run by idiots.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump had also begun feuding with his chief of staff, John Kelly, who had helped impose discipline in the White House and shared many of Trump\u2019s more conservative immigration views. But he and Nielsen had also been privately complaining about Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a wall on the southern border as ill-advised and \u201csilly\u201d since their early days in the administration, when Kelly was secretary of homeland security and Nielson was his senior adviser, according to a person familiar with their discussions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop on Wednesday, Kelly told lawmakers in a private meeting that Trump had \u201cevolved\u201d on his view of the wall and that some of the more hard-line immigration policies Trump had pushed for during the campaign were \u201cuninformed.\u201d He repeated the general message in a television interview the same day.\n\nThe president was furious and pushed back against his chief of staff in a series of tweets the next day without directly naming him. \u201cThe Wall is the Wall,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.\u201d\n\nThe final 24 hours before the shutdown played out in a dizzying series of private huddles, frenzied phone calls and belligerent public pronouncements from both sides. Through it all, the president remained mercurial and unreadable even to those ostensibly negotiating with him.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), head of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said Trump called him Thursday to say he wanted the House to debate a more conservative immigration bill being proposed by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). But the president also said he did not want a shutdown. \u201cHe mentioned that several times,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nAnd Trump \u2014 who has previously told associates a shutdown might be good for him politically \u2014 complained that he would be blamed for any outcome. Shutdowns, he concluded, never help the people in charge.\n\n[\u2018Pulling at his strings\u2019: Lawmakers vie to sway Trump in immigration fight]\n\nHe made an impromptu call Friday to Schumer and invited him to the White House, worrying congressional Republican leaders and aides who feared, in the words of one, that they were \u201cabout to get hosed.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans relished the spot Schumer was in \u2014 torn between liberals positioning for a 2020 presidential race and centrists facing reelection in 2018 in conservative states \u2014 and wanted to keep him under pressure.\n\nOver cheeseburgers in the private dining room just off the Oval Office, Trump and Schumer discussed a comprehensive deal that would include an immigration component and keep the government open, along with disaster relief and budget caps. Schumer signaled he would be open to considering funding for Trump\u2019s border wall and providing more defense spending, but he wanted the president to agree to a five-day measure to keep the government open to give both sides time to negotiate something longer term.\n\nAt one point, Schumer asked Trump to tweet in favor of a short-term bill to pressure others, officials said. The top Senate Democrat left the meeting buoyed, telling others that Trump seemed willing to strike a deal.\n\nBut as the day wore on, McConnell urged Kelly to not give in. Worried White House aides began making calls to their counterparts on the Hill, assuring them that Trump wouldn\u2019t \u201cgive away the store,\u201d in the words of one top Republican aide. The president summoned Meadows and Rep. Ra\u00fal R. Labrador (R-Idaho), another member of the Freedom Caucus, to the Oval Office for a long meeting, even as aides to Trump and Schumer discussed possible deals in writing.\n\nTrump called Schumer a few hours later and said he understood there was a deal for a three-week measure to fund the government \u2014 the first that Schumer had heard of any such deal, according to one person familiar with the issue. At another point, Kelly called Schumer, telling the Democrat that his immigration proposal was too liberal and would not work for the administration.\n\nSchumer wondered aloud to his members about what, exactly, had changed.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the President Trump who asked us to come up with a deal and promised that he would take heat for it?\u201d Schumer asked on the Senate floor shortly after the government shutdown had begun at midnight. \u201cWhat happened to that president? He backed off at the first sign of pressure.\u201d\n\nBut early Saturday morning, there was no Trump to be found. He was cloistered at the White House away from public view. Another promising deal \u2014 so tantalizingly close \u2014 had somehow slipped away.\n\nCarol Leonnig and Philip Rucker contributed to this report.", "title": "'Negotiating with Jell-O': How Trump's shifting positions fueled the rush to a shutdown - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/negotiating-with-jell-o-how-trumps-shifting-positions-fueled-the-rush-to-a-shutdown/2018/01/20/81215b90-fd71-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:53:25Z"}, {"textData": "In honor of that second anniversary, let\u2019s think about Hillary\u2019s side of the story. Before we begin, it\u2019s important to agree that this is not going to involve any discussion of whether she should have gone to Wisconsin more. Therein lies madness.\n\nHere\u2019s my take: Her campaign was probably doomed from the start and utterly transformative.\n\nDoomed because when a president has served for two terms, Americans are inclined to go for change and pick the other party next time \u2014 even if things have been going along rather swimmingly. That\u2019s generally been the modern pattern and it\u2019s probably going to become even more true now that what\u2019s left of our attention span is being pulverized by cellphones. And in 2016 if you were going to find a candidate who seemed to promise more of the same, it would have to be the woman who had been secretary of state for the departing two-term Democratic president, and was married to the two-term Democratic president before that.\n\nI suppose she could have emerged after the nomination, dressed in white for the suffragists, and said, \u201cLook, I love those guys but I\u2019ll be totally different.\u201d Would have been tough. Dissing both the first African-American president and her husband, who seems to take rejection of his legacy rather badly. Anyhow, didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThis is the point where we start sinking into a dark hole, mulling whether she should have spent more time in Wisconsin. Then, of course, comes the question of whether Clinton lost because she was a woman. The answer is: sort of. Her gender was both a handicap and an enormous selling point. Would the Democrats have wanted Harry Clinton to be their nominee? (Just try to construct a Harry Clinton in your mind. I dare you.)\n\nAnd \u2014 wait a minute, don\u2019t get depressed. There\u2019s another side: Even if her sex was a problem, it allowed her to transform the country more than many men who won the job. While losing, she made it normal for women to run for the most powerful office on the planet.\n\nThis is critical. Look at all the breakthroughs women have made in the last century, and you\u2019ll notice how many of them involved just making their presence in some new place seem matter of fact. All that pain and struggle to win the right to vote, and what did it get us short term? Warren Harding. But long term, it created a world where the big gubernatorial election in Virginia was analyzed in terms of women in the suburbs and that knockout Senate race in Alabama was pretty much all about black women streaming to the polls.\n\nOr take a more modest example. There was a time \u2014 not all that long ago \u2014 when television executives believed a woman could not be the solo anchor on the national evening news because our voices didn\u2019t convey the proper sense of authority. Then in 2006, Katie Couric took over at CBS, to great hubbub and commentary. She did fine. Life moved on. In 2009 Diane Sawyer became the anchor at ABC. She did fine. There was barely a peep. The great triumph actually did not arrive until everybody found the whole matter boring.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, when people handicap the next Democratic presidential nomination, there are lots of women in the mix \u2014 Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand. (And, O.K., Oprah.) Whoever runs, the important thing is that primary debates will no longer resemble Shriner conventions. Women will be all over the place. Soon, they\u2019ll be half the big decision-makers. It will be normal.\n\nWhen Hillary Rodham Clinton graduated from law school and started her career, virtually the only women who had made it into the Senate were either honorary appointees for a brief symbolic term (the first, Rebecca Latimer Felton, got one day) or a senator\u2019s widow. The exceptions proved the rule. The great Margaret Chase Smith came from the House, where she had succeeded her dead husband. Nancy Kassebaum happened to be the daughter of the Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon.\n\nYou get the idea. And there was Hillary. On the one hand, another political wife. On another, a marker for the entire country, driving home the fact that Congress was never going to be just a guy thing again. At times of despair I like to recall that when she was sworn into the Senate in 2001, my little niece watched the coverage intensely, and asked my sister whether it was possible for men to be senators, too.\n\nCampaigning in 2000, almost everywhere Clinton went, she drew enthusiastic crowds. Partly, they were there to see the first-lady-turned-candidate, the one who had come through more disasters than the Titanic. Partly they were already imagining their party\u2019s next standard-bearer. But nobody seemed more excited than women around her own age, who turned out in droves, no matter how unpleasant the weather or remote the spot. I always thought they saw her and thought about second chances: If you put in the time as a stay-at-home mother or took non-dream jobs because of all the responsibilities at home, you could still move on at midlife to something new and totally terrific. And maybe the kids would be sitting proudly behind you on the bus, like Chelsea.\n\nThat Senate race was the moment when she found her own identity as a politician. Floundering in the early high-profile media moments, she retreated off to long tours of upstate New York in which she went from one earnest panel discussion on economic development to another about the dairy compact. That, it turned out, was the Hillary version people liked best. Super-prepared, taking every problem seriously. She tried to resurrect it for her presidential campaign but the country was, it seemed, looking for something more exciting. Except for the 65.8 million people who voted for her.\n\nIt\u2019s 2018, a big election year, and women are going to be running everywhere. We\u2019re sort of astonished by the numbers, but not by their ambition. They\u2019ll be elected to city councils, state legislatures and Congress and hardly anyone will give their gender a second thought. That\u2019s Hillary\u2019s gift.\n\nHere\u2019s the message she left us. You can have that double dip at opportunity \u2014 you can even have a third or fourth chance if things go wrong. All you need to do is ignore every setback and work like a maniac.\n\nAnd also, you could think about changing the Electoral College.", "title": "Op-Ed Columnist: Hillary Lost, but the Future Is Hers", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/opinion/hillary-clinton-politics-future.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:53:09Z"}, {"textData": "The problem with America \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s playground \u2014 is that we\u2019ve developed an insular, conflict-averse culture.

We must learn to defend ourselves so that when Donald Trump or any other bully taunts us, we can rise to the occasion.\n\nMost of us, liberals and conservatives alike, live in well-insulated echo chambers where Rachel Maddow or Sean Hannity deliver more eloquent renditions of our own opinions in hyperbolic form. No wonder the American political system is suffering from an epic communication breakdown. Ensconced in our cocoons, we have lost the ability to talk to people with different views.\n\nI was as shocked as many people were when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election. As one of my friends mused: \u201cHow could Hillary lose? All my Facebook friends voted for her.\u201d This monumental distortion of perspectives has culminated in the Trump administration\u2019s genius postmodern claim that any unfavorable facts are \u201cfake news.\u201d But many liberals woke up on Nov. 9 also declared the election fake news.\n\nA few weeks ago, during a play date, my daughter and her best friend were sitting across the table from another 4-year-old, having an after-school snack.

Nina is sitting next to nobody. Nina is sitting next to nobody.\n\nOne of the hardest choices parents face is when to intervene in our children\u2019s lives.

But when Nina looked about to cry, I relented: \u201cGuys, please apologize to Nina for hurting her feelings.\u201d It was, after all, America, and I wanted my daughter to have friends.\n\nKids don\u2019t live in a bubble, so why do we try to shelter them from conflict? One of the earliest lessons you learn at school is about the boundless cruelty of other children. And that bullies can win. Yet contrary to these early playground lessons in realpolitik, children are consistently taught to avoid conflict by well-meaning parents, teachers and caregivers because that\u2019s how we want the world to work. We raise our children in gilded playpens, shielding them from criticism and alternative views.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has convinced me to give my daughter some tough love. To expose her to critical opinions, to make her listen to views she might not like or agree with. I don\u2019t want her to lose it when somebody like Donald Trump is elected. More than anything, I want her to be able to defend herself and fight back.\n\nI want my daughter to learn to say no confidently and unapologetically. Dealing with conflict is also about standing up for yourself as a woman, whether a man is talking over you at a meeting or trying to engage in unwanted sexual behavior. If we learn early how to have difficult or uncomfortable conversations up front, we don\u2019t need others to fill in the gaps, make our decisions or read our minds. But if we can\u2019t stand up to conflict, we risk becoming the snowflakes that the Donald Trumps and the wagging tongues on the right make us out to be.\n\nFinally, I want my daughter to think about the larger world, beyond the echo chamber that narrowly reflects her own experiences and views.

That said, due to the government shutdown we\u2019ve had to cancel activities not directly related to national defense.\u201d\n\nHerritage added that, while many of the athletic department\u2019s personnel are civilians, the school was canceling activities \u201cgiven the limitations imposed by the shutdown.\u201d\n\n[Everything you need to know about a government shutdown]\n\nFederal agencies began shutting down overnight for the first time since October 2013; that standoff lasted 18 days before a spending bill was passed. The longest shutdown lasted 21 days, from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996. Congress reconvened Saturday morning in hopes of reaching a deal to reopen the federal government.\n\nAlong with canceling games, Air Force athletic teams will not be able to conduct their regularly scheduled practices during the shutdown.

Above is a section where some had ticketed seats in front of the U.S. Capitol. (CNN/Photo illustration by The Washington Post)\n\nIn the days before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, a wealthy Russian pharmaceutical executive named Alexey Repik arrived in Washington, expressing excitement about the new administration.\n\nHe posted a photo on Facebook of a clutch of inauguration credentials arranged next to a white \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, writing in Russian: \u201cI believe that President Donald Trump will open a new page in American history.\u201d\n\nThroughout his trip, Repik had prime access. He wrote on Facebook that he got close enough to the president-elect at a pre-inaugural event to \u201ccheck the handshake strength of Donald Trump.\u201d He and his wife, Polina Repik, witnessed Trump\u2019s swearing-in from ticketed seats in front of the U.S. Capitol. And he posed for a photo shoulder-to-shoulder with Mike Pompeo, the president\u2019s nominee to head the CIA, although Repik later said he was not aware of Pompeo\u2019s intended role at the time.\n\nThe attendance of members of Russia\u2019s elite at Trump\u2019s inauguration was evidence of the high anticipation in Moscow for a thaw in U.S.-Russia relations following a campaign in which Trump stunned U.S. foreign-policy experts by repeatedly praising Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin.\n\nA prominent Russian businessman and his wife came to Washington, D.C. a year ago to celebrate the beginning of the Trump era, and they captured it all on their phones (Alice Li,Jesse Mesner-Hage/The Washington Post)\n\nAs questions about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election were beginning to percolate publicly, prominent business leaders and activists from the country attended inaugural festivities, mingling at balls and receptions \u2014 at times in proximity to key U.S. political officials.\n\nTheir presence caught the attention of counterintelligence officials at the FBI, according to former U.S. officials, although it is not clear which attendees drew U.S. government interest. FBI officials were concerned at the time because some of the figures had surfaced in the agency\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, the officials said.\n\nAn FBI spokesman declined to comment on security concerns related to the inauguration. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Washington Post identified at least half a dozen politically connected Russians who were in Washington on Inauguration Day \u2014 including some whose presence has not been previously reported. Among them was Viktor Vekselberg, a tycoon who is closely aligned with Putin\u2019s government.\n\nAnother was Natalia Veselnitskaya , the Russian lawyer whose June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr. has become a focus of the Russia investigation. She attended a black-tie inaugural party hosted by the campaign committee of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), according to an associate who accompanied her.\n\nOther Russian inaugural guests included Boris Titov, a politician and business advocate who is running for president of Russia with the Kremlin\u2019s blessing.\n\nLike other VIPs in town that weekend, many flocked to the lobby of the Trump International Hotel, where some encountered fellow Russian associates with surprise.\n\n\u201cIt was a great, amazing experience,\u201d Alexey Repik recalled in one of several interviews with The Post. Repik said he also was in Washington for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration but did not attend any events that year.\n\nMichael McFaul, who served as ambassador to Russia under Obama, said he did not recall prominent Russian visitors at Obama\u2019s 2009 events. \u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d McFaul, the director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford, said of the number of influential Russians in attendance last year.\n\nSome Russian guests at Trump\u2019s inauguration said they got tickets through U.S. political contacts.\n\nOne venue for credentials was the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which provided a slew of perks \u2014 such as tickets to events with Cabinet appointees, congressional leaders, the vice president-elect and Trump \u2014 to donors who gave at least $25,000.\n\nOnly U.S. citizens and permanent residents are legally permitted to contribute to an inaugural committee. Several U.S. business executives with ties to Russia together donated $2.4 million to the inaugural committee, campaign finance records show.\n\n\n\nRussian pharmaceutical executive Alexey Repik and his wife, Polina Repik, enjoyed high-level access during Trump\u2019s inauguration, including ticketed seats for his swearing-in. (CNN/Photo illustration by The Washington Post)\n\nInaugural organizers said that the committee kept proper records of contributors but that it was impossible to track who ultimately used all of the tens of thousands of tickets that went to donors. In a statement, the committee said that it followed Secret Service protocol and that all attendees received required physical screening at checkpoints when they arrived at events.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Inaugural Committee for President Trump, administratively speaking, was conducted in similar, if not identical fashion to previous inaugurations,\u201d the committee said.\n\nHowever, Steve Kerrigan, who served as chief of staff to Obama\u2019s 2009 inaugural committee and as president of the committee in 2013, said donors then were required to submit lists of their guests for any gathering the president or vice president or their families were scheduled to attend, with the exception of large outdoor events.\n\nSecret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said the agency followed all of its normal security procedures at the 2017 inauguration. She declined to elaborate.\n\nThe service often requires that the names of guests be submitted ahead of time for events at which attendees will have close access to the president.\n\nOn other occasions, when the president or president-elect makes a brief stop at an event and stays largely behind a rope line \u2014 as Trump did at a pre-inaugural Library of Congress reception Repik attended \u2014 the agency instead relies on physically screening most guests, according to people familiar with the security procedures.\n\nAwaiting a \u2018new stage\u2019 in U.S.-Russia relations\n\nTrump\u2019s inauguration was celebrated jubilantly in Moscow, where Putin supporter Konstantin Rykov hosted an all-night party. Champagne flowed as an interpreter narrated the new U.S. president\u2019s speech.\n\nIn Washington, the Russian Embassy tweeted, \u201cHappy #InaugurationDay2017!\u201d with a photo of people gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nThe optimism was part of a larger embrace by Russia of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d outlook, which emphasizes U.S. business interests and national security over promoting freedom and democracy abroad, said Ilya Zaslavskiy, a researcher who has worked with the Hudson Institute\u2019s Kleptocracy Initiative.\n\nAmid a busy schedule in Washington, Titov \u2014 who was appointed by Putin to serve as a business ombudsman \u2014 told a Russian television station that new investment was likely to flow to Russia once U.S. sanctions were lifted.\n\nBusinesses \u201care waiting for this signal, and they believe it will soon come,\u201d he said.\n\nA year later, the sanctions are still in place, and the thrill of Trump\u2019s election has faded amid an intensifying federal investigation of possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cWe hoped that a lot of things would change, that the relations would be built on equal terms, that we would be able to start a new stage in the relations between countries,\u201d Titov said in an interview. \u201cBut unfortunately, this is not happening.\u201d\n\nTitov, like several of the Russian elites who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, declined to say how he obtained his tickets, only that they came \u201cvia our friends \u2014 entrepreneurs in the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nWhile in Washington, he attended several receptions and met with U.S. lawmakers and business leaders, including a staff member at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Titov said. A Chamber spokeswoman said the organization \u201croutinely meets with individuals representing the business community from countries around the world.\u201d\n\nTitov said he also went to a ball, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t remember what it was called. People danced. Trump danced.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nVekselberg heads of one of Russia\u2019s most powerful conglomerates, the Renova Group, which has investments in energy, telecom and mining. He attended Trump\u2019s inauguration as a guest of \u201cone of his closest American business partners,\u201d said spokesman Andrey Shtorkh, who declined to name Vekselberg\u2019s host.\n\nShtorkh said that Vekselberg had met the past three U.S. presidents as part of his efforts to expand Russia\u2019s international economic relations but that this was the first time the magnate attended a presidential inauguration.\n\nVekselberg regularly participates in gatherings of Russian business leaders with Putin and sometimes meets one on one with the Russian president, according to news accounts and people familiar with his role. In March, the two sat down to discuss infrastructure projects, according to Russian state news reports. Vekselberg funds several critically important Russian prestige projects, including Skolkovo, the business incubator touted as Russia\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley.\n\nTwo of Vekselberg\u2019s U.S. business associates donated significant sums to the inaugural committee, federal filings show.\n\nAndrew Intrater, a New York businessman who is president of the U.S. affiliate of Vekselberg\u2019s company, gave $250,000. Intrater did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccess Industries, a company founded by Leonard Blavatnik \u2014 a Soviet-born American British billionaire who is a longtime friend and business associate of Vekselberg \u2014 contributed $1 million to the committee. Blavatnik, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nAnother Russian American who has had business dealings in Russia, IMG Artists chief executive Alexander Shustorovich, also gave $1 million, records show. IMG Artists\u2019 chief operating officer, John Evans, said Shustorovich, a U.S. citizen who immigrated to the country as a child, attended the inauguration with his parents. Evans said Shustorovich was a longtime Republican supporter who also attended the presidential inaugurations of George W. Bush.\n\nSome of the Russian attendees at inaugural events already had interacted with people in Trump\u2019s orbit during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAmong them: Maria Butina, a Russian gun rights activist and assistant to Alexander Torshin, a former Russian senator who had brokered ties with top National Rifle Association officials.\n\n[Guns and religion: How American conservatives grew closer to Putin\u2019s Russia]\n\nMore than a year before Trump\u2019s victory, Butina had found her way to a microphone at a July 2015 town hall meeting to ask candidate Trump how he would approach Russia if elected.\n\n\u201cI know Putin, and I\u2019ll tell you what, we get along with Putin,\u201d Trump responded. (Trump later said that he had not met Putin before his election but told voters that he was confident they would get along.)\n\nButina was also part of a group that unsuccessfully sought a meeting with the campaign in May 2016 to discuss the persecution of Christians around the world, according to an American involved in the effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s inauguration, Butina made an appearance at one of the balls, according to a person familiar with her attendance. She did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Russian lawyer, Veselnitskaya, had met Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, during a private June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York. Trump Jr. had agreed to the gathering after he was told Veselnitskaya would provide damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as part of a Russian effort to assist his father\u2019s campaign.\n\nJoining Veselnitskaya at the meeting was Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian American lobbyist and Soviet army veteran.\n\nSeven months later, they were together again in Washington at an inauguration night black-tie party at the Library of Congress sponsored by the campaign committee of Rohrabacher, a GOP congressman who has long advocated that the United States have a better relationship with Putin\u2019s Russia. In a photo from the event posted by the campaign committee, Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin pose with slight smiles, holding wine glasses.\n\nIn a statement, Veselnitskaya told The Post that she attended a private event in Washington that night at Akhmetshin\u2019s invitation. She added that she did not go to the inauguration and was in the area because she was meeting the next day with an American woman frustrated by the Russian ban on adoptions by U.S. citizens.\n\nMichael Tremonte, a lawyer for Akhmetshin, said his client recalls that he was given tickets by a person involved in organizing the event and that he invited Veselnitskaya to join him because he knew she was in town. Tremonte said Akhmetshin did not attend any official inaugural events.\n\nKenneth Grubbs, a spokesman for Rohrabacher\u2019s congressional office, said the campaign has no record of Akhmetshin\u2019s invitation to the party or of tickets purchased by him or Veselnitskaya.\n\n\n\nRussian American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who both attended a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump aides during the presidential campaign, went to an inaugural party in Washington hosted by U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.). (Rohrabacher for Congress)\n\n\u2018It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience\u2019\n\nRepik began his weekend in Washington by posting a photo of himself wearing official credentials in front a stage bearing a sign that declared \u201cThe Inauguration of Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nIn interviews with The Post, Repik said he and his wife obtained their tickets through an American technology executive named Timothy Kasbe, who at the time was working for the Russia-based retailer Gloria Jeans. Kasbe, who now works for a company in New Zealand, donated $150,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, records show.\n\nRepik said they had met months earlier during a tour of Silicon Valley companies for Russian business executives that Kasbe helped host on behalf of a headhunting firm. The two became friendly and agreed to meet in Washington for the Trump festivities.\n\nIn a statement, Kasbe confirmed that he celebrated the inauguration with Repik and his wife, whom he called \u201cfamily friends from California.\u201d\n\nRepik, whose family often stays in a home in a posh San Francisco neighborhood, founded the large Russian pharmaceutical company R-Pharm, which has contracts with numerous Russian hospitals, including state-owned facilities.\n\nRepik also heads an advocacy group called Business Russia, as well as another business council that encourages economic ties between Russia and Japan.\n\nIn those roles, Repik said, he has met several times with Putin at public events to discuss the business climate and foreign relations. They had a one-on-one meeting publicized by the Kremlin in June 2016 and met again when Putin made an appearance at an October 2016 conference hosted by Repik\u2019s advocacy group.\n\nIn 2011, the Russian business publication Vedomosti asked Repik about rumors that he had ties to the FSB, the Russian intelligence service that succeeded the KGB. Repik replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to feel like a simpleton who has the FSB behind him.\u201d\n\nRepik told The Post that such comments were \u201cjokes\u201d and that he has \u201czero\u201d relationship with Russia\u2019s security and intelligence services.\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s inauguration, Repik established a business tie with Texas venture capitalist Darren Blanton, who served as an informal adviser to the Trump transition team.\n\n[The mystery behind a Flynn associate\u2019s quiet work for the Trump campaign]\n\nIn the fall of 2016, a venture fund backed by Repik\u2019s R-Pharm and the Russian government negotiated to become a large investor in a California biotechnology start-up called Bonti, a deal that closed Jan. 4, 2017, according to corporate filings and people familiar with the investment. Colt Ventures, an investment company founded by Blanton, also invested in Bonti, filings show.\n\nAt some point, Blanton and Repik met in San Francisco with other investors to discuss the company, Repik said.\n\nRepik said the Texas investor was also among the people he ran into at the Trump hotel in Washington, where he and his wife stayed for the inauguration.\n\nBlanton did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPolina Repik, a former model with a sizable social media following, recorded the exclusive access she and her husband had during the inauguration, posting videos about the trip on her YouTube channel. \u201cI\u2019m really far from politics,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\u201d\n\nAt the inaugural parade, the couple were perched in a grandstand just next to the one reserved for Trump and his family. They danced the night away at the Liberty Ball, where Polina Repik filmed a chance encounter with Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nPolina Repik also toured The Washington Post\u2019s newsroom with Kasbe, who arranged the visit through a former colleague who is a Post executive.\n\nA video from the tour that Polina Repik posted on YouTube features footage of the newsroom. The Post public-relations manager who led the tour said that visitors are generally not allowed to film throughout the newsroom and that she did not recall seeing any filming. In an interview, Polina Repik said that she was not trying to film surreptitiously and that she was sorry if she broke any rules.\n\nAlexey Repik also documented his up-close access at inaugural events, posting photos on Facebook of the president-elect, son Eric Trump, incoming vice president Mike Pence and incoming Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus. At one event, Repik told The Post, he met incoming secretary of state Rex Tillerson and encountered Pompeo, whom he described on Facebook as \u201ca good neighbor at the table [who] turned out to be a very charming person.\u201d\n\nRepik said he was actually seated at a table nearby and was not aware at the time of Pompeo\u2019s role as the soon-to-be CIA director. Repik added that he had not met Pompeo before that event or seen him since.\n\nIn a statement, a CIA spokesman said that Pompeo \u201cdoes not know this individual or recall meeting him,\u201d adding that \u201cpeople frequently ask public figures, like Mr. Pompeo, for photographs, and efforts to cast the photo as anything else are ridiculous.\u201d\n\nRepik said it wasn\u2019t politics that drew him to Washington but the prospect of fostering better business relations between Russia and the United States.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s pretty clear that we can do better together,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the political. But I\u2019m very concerned about the business part of this.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Dwoskin in San Francisco; Natalya Abbakumova and David Filipov in Moscow; and Devlin Barrett, Alice Crites, Tom Hamburger, Shane Harris, Ellen Nakashima, T.J.

Fillmore was a stolid, self-made man who would in time alienate slavery opponents and leave his party in disarray, earning his place among the worst presidents. In his first year, though, he helped to broker the Compromise of 1850, which most of the nation greeted as a great achievement, securing what Fillmore proclaimed (albeit prematurely) as \u201ca final settlement\u201d of sectional discord over slavery.\n\nFillmore\u2019s successor, the Democrat Franklin Pierce \u2014 an amiable man who was pliable and prone to depression and drink \u2014 entered the White House in 1853 grieving the death of his 11-year-old son in a train wreck. But Pierce\u2019s successful first year helped lift his gloom, as Commodore Matthew Perry\u2019s momentous first landing in Japan opened that country to trade and the Gadsden Purchase brought what is now southern Arizona and a slice of New Mexico into the United States. Only in Pierce\u2019s second year did his support for the controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act help rip open the national divisions over slavery, threatening the Union and destroying his presidency.\n\nWarren G. Harding \u2014 darkly handsome, impeccably dressed and widely adored \u2014 acquired a reputation for cronyism, corruption and womanizing that continues to stain the reputation of his administration, which ended when he died of a heart attack in 1923. But while the corruption was very real, the worst of it, above all the Teapot Dome scandal, did not come to light until after his death.\n\nHarding\u2019s first year actually brought some auspicious legislative accomplishments, including passage of the Federal Highway Act of 1921, which invested millions in the nation\u2019s infant highway system. In October, Harding addressed a huge segregated crowd in Birmingham, Ala., and courageously urged equal political rights for blacks, without which, he said, \u201cour democracy is a lie.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, he pardoned the socialist Eugene V. Debs, who had been imprisoned for speaking out against World War I; he even insisted that Debs (who had run against him for president from prison) pay a visit to the White House. In public Harding was a paragon of dignity, and his death was universally mourned.\n\nRichard M. Nixon\u2019s first year in office produced mixed results. He continued the Vietnam War but floated reforms such as a guaranteed annual income for the poor. He hinted at retreating from civil rights laws and court rulings, but enforced them. The year also yielded innovations like the National Environmental Policy Act, which Nixon signed into law in January 1970. The mixture of arrogance and paranoia that would lead to the Watergate scandal did not take hold until later.\n\nGeorge W. Bush has made some worst-presidents lists because of the disastrous Iraq war and the collapse of the economy under his watch. But his first year was notable for his post-Sept. 11 leadership, when he rallied the country\u2019s spirit while cautioning Americans not to turn their grief and outrage into reprisals against Muslims. He ended his first year with an approval rating in the Gallup poll of 83 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnly two of the failed presidents had horrendous first years, which, like Mr. Trump\u2019s, were a result largely of their own actions. James Buchanan, a wealthy bachelor, at all times courteous and dignified, connived behind the scenes even before he was inaugurated to help coax the Supreme Court into the calamitous Dred Scott decision of 1857, handed down a few days after his swearing-in and widely considered among the court\u2019s worst.\n\nCalculated to suppress antislavery politics once and for all, the decision instead alarmed Northerners by allowing the expansion of slavery \u2014 and it helped set the nation on the political course that ended in civil war. The financial panic of 1857 and subsequent depression, the splintering of the Union and the later exposure of rampant corruption inside the executive branch added to the sense of Buchanan\u2019s fecklessness.\n\nAndrew Johnson, a vituperative racist, was temperamentally and politically unsuited to succeed the slain Abraham Lincoln. His troubles began when he showed up for his swearing-in as vice president drunk and belligerent. Lincoln, aghast, is supposed to have said that he never wanted to speak to Johnson again.\n\nAfter becoming president through assassination, Johnson at first signaled he would take a hard line against the defeated rebels, but then switched to attacking civil rights for the former slaves, siding with the ex-Confederates and engaging in abusive tirades against the Radical Republicans in Congress. He closed his first year by vetoing the Civil Rights Bill, which would have given the former slaves citizenship. Both houses of Congress swiftly overrode the veto, setting in motion the events that would end with Johnson\u2019s impeachment in 1868.\n\nWhat do these bad presidents\u2019 first years tell us about Mr. Trump? Some performed reasonably well at first, only to slide into disaster later. Might Mr. Trump grow in the job, making us forget his rookie-season bumbling? Or should we expect more of the same through 2020?\n\nI expect the latter. Mr. Trump\u2019s first year has been an unremitting parade of disgraces that have demeaned him as well as the dignity of his office, and he has shown that this is exactly how he believes he should govern.\n\nMost important, he is the first president to fail to defend the nation from an attack on our democracy by a hostile foreign power \u2014 and to resist the investigation of that attack. He is the first to enrich his private interests, and those of his family, directly and openly.\n\nHe is the first president to denounce the press not simply as unfair but as \u201cthe enemy of the American people.\u201d He is the first to threaten his defeated political opponent with imprisonment. He is the first to have denigrated friendly countries and allies as well as a whole continent with racist vulgarities.\n\nGeorge Washington warned that the actions of a president \u201cmay have great and durable consequences from their having been established at the commencement of a new general government.\u201d If history is any guide \u2014 especially in light of the examples closest to his, of Buchanan and Andrew Johnson \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s first year portends a very unhappy ending.", "title": "Op-Ed Contributor: They Were Bad.

Organizers said they hope to build on efforts that have pushed women\u2019s issues to the forefront during the politically chaotic year since Trump took office.\n\n[Clad in pink and vowing to vote, activists around the globe flood streets for another Women\u2019s March]\n\nThese are five breakthroughs that followed the Women's March on Washington, which took place the day after President Trump's inauguration. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\nThat message was delivered repeatedly by a number of speakers, including top Democratic leaders, many of whom remained in Washington because of the shutdown.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) led more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers on the stage and told the marchers they had \u201ctransformed the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour truth is never more important than now,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi pointed out that many more people had turned out for last year\u2019s march than had attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, and she said the president deserves an F for his first year in office.\n\nTrump, at the White House, weighed in on the marches: \u201cBeautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cGet out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!\u201d\n\nAt the rally, there were few Trump supporters to be found. On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, protesters held up a sign that spelled out \u201cImpeach#45\u201d on one side and \u201cNarcissist\u201d on the other. Another carried a sign that referenced a villain and heroine in the Harry Potter series: \u201cWhen Voldemort is president we need a nation of Hermiones.\u201d Others made the coming fall elections their focus, proclaiming \u201cBlue tsunami coming in 2018\u201d and \u201cGrab \u2019em by the midterms.\u201d\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), often mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, also addressed the crowd.\n\n1 of 24 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene at the second Women\u2019s March on Washington View Photos Demonstrators participating in the Women\u2019s March urge women to run for public office and call on citizens to fully engage on issues including sexual assault, racial equality, immigrant protections and gun violence.

Don Beyer (D-Va.) drew cheers when he criticized Republican congressional leaders and Trump. \u201c I am sure that if Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan and the president were women, we would not be in the middle of a government shutdown right now,\u201d Beyer said.\n\n\u201cPlease run! Run smart! Run hard!\u201d he urged the crowd.\n\nLast year\u2019s march \u201cwas a rallying cry for a lot of women who wanted their voices to be heard,\u201d said Emily Patton, a spokeswoman for the Women\u2019s March. \u201cThis year, we really want to show support for women who are running for office and to encourage more women, women of color and those in the LGBT community, to run for office, to register to vote, to be more civically engaged.\u201d\n\nLauren Owensby, 51, a Sterling, Va., mother with five daughters, said she has a \u201chouse full of feminists\u201d who have been on fire since Trump was elected. She brought two of her daughters to the march, as well as her mother, \u201can activist for 60 years.\u201d\n\nThe federal contractor said her community went into high gear last year.\n\n\u201cAfter Trump was elected, you have never seen so many people come out of their suburban doors and say they want to get involved,\u201d she said.\n\nThere have been coffees, cocktail parties, letter writing \u2014 all aimed at opposing Trump and helping get women and Democrats elected in Virginia.\n\n\u201cWomen are working, raising families and resisting,\u201d Owensby said. \u201cWe don\u2019t read books. We don\u2019t watch movies anymore. We don\u2019t have any time.\u201d\n\nDilcia M. Molina held up a sign in Spanish calling for the protection of immigrant women. She is a health program manager at a D.C. clinic that works with immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe want to demonstrate that immigrant women have a right to live without violence, without ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] looking for them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all immigrated for some reason, because of violence in our countries, because of poverty.\u201d\n\nJudy Glaven, 57, brought the same \u201cBe Brave Choose Love\u201d poster she marched with last year. It is covered with tape because she has taken it to so many demonstrations over the past year.\n\n\u201cLast year I was in shock and depressed. Now I feel determined. I am going to keep working at this,\u201d said the molecular cell biologist from the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington. She said that since last year\u2019s march, she has met with senators and representatives, organized her neighbors, and gone to dozens of protests. \u201cThere is not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t do something,\u201d she said.\n\nVictor Udoewa, a technology policy adviser, was changing his daughter\u2019s diaper while his wife got ready to sing with her social-justice a cappella choir for the assembling marchers. He said the last year has been revealing more than anything, and in some positive ways. \u201cPeople thought we were further along with sexism and racism than we are,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the rally at the Lincoln Memorial, many made their way over to Lafayette Square in front of the White House, where impromptu protests continued.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally felt quieter and calmer than last year\u2019s, but not everything went smoothly. A number of frustrated marchers found that the public restrooms near the Reflecting Pool were closed. A note posted by the National Park Service explained that this was due to the shutdown.\n\nThere were also a few showdowns between marchers and antiabortion protesters, who held up large photos showing aborted fetuses and advertised numbers to call for women facing a crisis pregnancy. Abortion rights activists stood in front of the protesters or blocked their messages with anti-Trump signs.\n\nWashington was the focus of last year\u2019s Women\u2019s March, with hundreds of thousands of protesters filling the streets of the capital. Some of the larger marches held Saturday were in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Charlotte and New York.\n\nOne of the biggest events will take place Sunday in Las Vegas, where a concerted effort is being made to push for voter registration. Democrats are eyeing the U.S. Senate race in swing state Nevada, where incumbent Dean Heller (R) is considered vulnerable and first-term Rep. Jacky Rosen (D) is a leading challenger. The Las Vegas rally will also focus on gun violence and sexual assault and is expected to include speeches by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, actress Marisa Tomei and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.).\n\nKayla Epstein and Erin Logan contributed to this report.", "title": "Protesters gather for a second Women's March in nation's capital - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/protesters-gather-for-a-second-womens-march-in-nations-capital/2018/01/20/c641bf16-fdef-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:38:01Z"}, {"textData": "One of late cult leader Charles Manson\u2018s youngest followers will remain in prison, after California Gov.

Literally. Donald Trump and a U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are set to arrive in Davos. America\u2019s populist-in-chief will surely make news, but there will be several storylines worth following this year.\n\nWanted: a leader for the West\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is still trying to cobble together a coalition government after her party \u201cwon\u201d German elections in November (this was the weakest of her four election victories.) She didn\u2019t even confirm her place at the Davos table until this weekend, and she will struggle to position herself as the great defender of Western liberal values\u2014especially when it is precisely those values (her expansive welcome for refugees, in particular) that weighed on her popularity at home and forced her to seek a partner in order to form a government.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has offered his leadership as an alternative, though he will need German help to realize the most ambitious of his European reform plans, and his steadfast opposition to Trump has won him fans at home and abroad. But French voters care first about security and prosperity in France, and if Macron\u2019s ambitious (and much-needed) economic reforms don\u2019t deliver the expected results, they may well turn on him, just as they turned on traditional parties of the center-left and center-right.\n\nYet, no one is likely to expect an eloquent defense of Western values from Donald Trump. For now, that seat will remain vacant.\n\nWhat will Modi say?\n\nChina\u2019s President Xi Jinping used his keynote address at Davos last year to step into the global leadership vacuum created by Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, kicking off a months-long PR-push that culminated in his triumphant announcement at China\u2019s 19th Party Congress in October that a \u201cnew era\u201d of geopolitics had begun.\n\nWe can expect more grand rhetoric from China this week, but more interesting is what Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planning for his opening address to the Davos crowd. India is already the world\u2019s most populous democracy. It\u2019s the world\u2019s seventh largest economy, and it\u2019s expected to become no. 2 (behind China) by 2050. India has adamantly refused to sign up for China\u2019s ambitious One Belt One Road infrastructure project, positioning itself as a potential counterweight to China\u2019s growing economic ambitions in Asia. There\u2019s already active talk of strengthening an Indo-Pacific security partnership between the US, India, Japan, and Australia.\n\nExpect Modi to focus his speech on economics, but listen carefully for any reference to India\u2019s views on geopolitics.\n\nThe Trump in the room\n\nLet\u2019s state the obvious: It\u2019s only the departure of senior strategist Steve Bannon that allows Trump to rub elbows with fashionable globalists at this mountain resort in Switzerland. Bannon was one of the president\u2019s few advisors whose devotion to economic populism was genuine. With Bannon gone, and cut loose by the Breitbart media machine, Trump is free to set out in search of flashbulbs, of which Davos will have many. How could this president miss the opportunity to pass among the world\u2019s movers and shakers?\n\nHe\u2019s set to deliver the closing address. Reports suggest Trump will use this prime speaking slot to promote his distinctly un-Davos \u201cAmerica First\u201d worldview. For a man who sees tactical value in picking fights\u2014however ill-considered\u2014that makes sense. Much more interesting will be the reaction the expected Trump comments will elicit. Remember, the opposite of love is indifference, not hate. Trump can handle (and usually welcomes) the animosity his comments provoke; it\u2019s being ignored that knocks him off balance.\n\nThe year Davos finally takes structural inequality seriously\u2026\n\nTreasury Secretary Mnuchin says he doesn\u2019t think Davos is \u201ca hangout for globalists.\u201d It is. And not just for globalists but for the top 0.001% of globalization\u2019s winners. But global elite status in 2018 isn\u2019t what it was in 2007. As wealth inequality grows larger in countries around the world\u2014the eight richest people on Earth now hold the same total amount of wealth as the poorest 4 billion\u2014globalization\u2019s prime beneficiaries are beginning to consider the consequences.\n\nEarlier this week, Larry Fink, CEO and chairman of BlackRock\u2014the largest asset manager in the world with more than $6 trillion under investment\u2014wrote an open letter to the CEOs of public companies in which his firm invests: \u201cSociety is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.\u201d\n\nThis would represent a sea-change in how companies think and operate their business; the fact that one of the most powerful individuals on Wall Street would raise this issue publicly underlines the reality that inequality has become an unavoidably obvious threat to everyone\u2019s peace and prosperity. Talk of structural economic inequality will be everywhere at Davos this year.\n\n\u2026and becomes more relevant\n\nYes, international politics are more fraught than we\u2019ve seen in a long time, and technological progress\u2014once heralded as the force that would wire the planet together\u2014appears more likely to divide societies from within as politics become more polarized and job creation appears less certain. All in all, it\u2019s a somber outlook.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all bad news\u2014the world has never seen so few people living in extreme poverty. The global economy continues to hum along despite all the political wrenches thrown into its gears. Globalization has always had clear winners and losers, but it\u2019s the losers of globalization that are getting increased attention as of late, and that\u2019s a positive development. Davos used to be a celebration of globalization. It\u2019s now a place where the cross-border flows of ideas, information, people, money, goods and services faces new scrutiny. That\u2019s exactly the type of Davos the world needs in 2018.", "title": "The 5 Things to Watch at Davos 2018", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5109012/davos-2018-what-to-watch/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:30:57Z"}, {"textData": "The news is so full of his lies and contradictions \u2014 to say nothing about harmful policies \u2014 that claims that he paid a pornographic film actress to keep quiet about an affair have scarcely kept the nation\u2019s attention.\n\nAnd he is never so shameless as when he is denying the significance of reports of his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia. Mr. Trump admitted during his campaign that he hadn\u2019t felt the need to ask God for forgiveness. It\u2019s now undeniable that we live \u2014 and to some extent, have always lived \u2014 in a political world in which shame is optional.\n\nGone, even, is the idea that videotaped evidence of misbehavior is dispositive. People clinging to old myths about what the public would tolerate could have been forgiven for believing that if we all saw and heard a candidate essentially admitting to being a sexual predator, we would all agree that this was unacceptable. But no. He whispers that it wasn\u2019t even him on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Suddenly, what was beyond debate is debatable.\n\nBut think of all the videos of black people being killed by the police while they put their hands up, or were lying face down. Think of how these killings were deemed \u201ccontroversial,\u201d and the perpetrators judged to have acted reasonably. We should have been warned years ago: We may all see and hear the same thing, but that\u2019s no guarantee that we agree that what happened before our eyes was real \u2014 or that it mattered. And when it comes to our regard for women and minorities who suffer as victims of abuse, there is no such thing as a single American set of values.\n\nA related myth thoroughly shattered by Mr. Trump: that an elected official in modern times must make at least a halfhearted effort to be something other than a racist. Until recently, it was conventional wisdom that politicians who were openly bigoted would be seen as villainous and would suffer punishment for their embarrassing views.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s endless series of racist comments and actions topped off by reports of his recent vulgar condemnation of immigrants from Haiti and Africa put an end to this.\n\nThe 1986 nomination to the federal bench of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was doomed by allegations of racism. A civil rights lawyer testified at that time that Mr. Sessions called the N.A.A.C.P. un-American for \u201ctrying to force civil rights down the throats of people.\u201d Coretta Scott King even wrote a letter to Congress warning that his dismal civil rights record would \u201cirreparably damage the work of my husband.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday, we\u2019re watching that happen. We were fed \u2014 and many of us embraced \u2014 the fantasy that the passing of time would naturally lead to more evolved views on race. It is now undeniable that this isn\u2019t the case. In policy and offhand commentary, open racism is now not only tolerated, but celebrated.\n\nIt is jarring. That is, if we forget that Strom Thurmond, who set the filibuster record in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957, or Jesse Helms, one of the most vile bigots ever in the United States Senate, were both serving at the turn of the millennium. None of this is new.\n\nThis last year has once and for all pulled back the facade of a genteel American politics, whose proclaimed values line up with those of the candidates we support. Evangelicals have cast their lot with a hedonistic president who seems to merely give the Bible lip service at public functions. And sure, Roy Moore, accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, lost his bid for the Senate, but it was far from a foregone conclusion. A year or two ago, we might have said: \u201cAn accused pedophile couldn\u2019t be a serious candidate. We\u2019re better than that.\u201d This year, we can\u2019t, at least about Republicans.\n\nA portrait of Andrew Jackson, who engineered the genocide of Native Americans, hangs before Mr. Trump\u2019s adoring eyes in the Oval Office, a reminder that, in politics, even what so many like to think of as the good old days weren\u2019t actually that good.\n\nIt was easier to believe our own pleasant fictions about the way things work in America before our president made a mockery of them. By lying to us, in a way he has made it impossible for us to lie to ourselves.

I returned home to Cleveland, where I\u2019ve been volunteering as a mentor and career counselor while deciding on my next move.\n\nThe values I shared and stood for overseas \u2014 fighting for the underdog, a fair shake for everyone, community action, integrity and tolerance \u2014 still have my focus and support, but now here, in this country.\n\nAt home, however, the president has seriously disrupted my personal life.

I understood that the easiest way to maintain our relationship would be to avoid any discussion of politics. But I could not.\n\nI was driven by two conflicting needs: One, to understand how someone who I knew to epitomize integrity, nation before self and commitment to public service could support this president. Two, to ensure she stayed informed so that she did not spend one single day feeling good about her choice. I opened all our conversations with that reminder as a joke \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t kidding. So I showered her with negative articles and invited her to send me positive ones. And we talked.\n\nWe talked by phone, and sometimes in person. Once, early on, we almost got thrown out of one of my favorite restaurants during a live and loud debate. But neither of us wanted to sever the relationship. So while we took some not-always-gentle abuse from each other, we mostly talked by text and email, which allowed for pauses between heated exchanges and timely silences.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe each called truces and timeouts at various times, and we each respected the other\u2019s need for a break.\n\nBut we talked and kept talking. In the spring, she texted me to talk about Representative Devin Nunes discussing surveillance information on Russia and to argue that the president was getting a bum rap, while I insisted that where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire.\n\nWe went at it for a few days over that and over the firings of several career officials, which left us exhausted with each other. After a few days of silence, we picked back up:\n\nHER Hello? Are you there? What are your thoughts on \u201cObama NSA illegally surveilled Americans for years\u201d? I do not contend that two wrongs make a right, but I do say there\u2019s no new behavior and the swamp is there to be dealt with.\n\nME Terrible! But that started with Bush. Shame on O for not stopping it before we got caught. So are you a Snowden fan for outing that?\n\nHER Nope. I say beating up the new guy is a waste of time and energy that could be used to solve real problems like the ones you talk about.\n\nA few days later, we kept the conversation going, with her arguing that the president was subject to excessive scrutiny.\n\nHER He is not the first to have bad form. Sadly the powers that be overturn every rock, scab, and snicker he makes to make him seem worse. Not even Obama could withstand such scrutiny. All the time! For months at a time. That was his job as a businessman. WTH?! He made money. Why hate on that? He wasn\u2019t Madoff!\n\nME Obama HAD such scrutiny ALL THE TIME. You\u2019re in some alternate reality now if you\u2019re suggesting otherwise.

In the summer, after John Kelly was appointed as the chief of staff, I wrote to ask what she thought of him and whether he would be able to manage a boss who seemed to prefer chaos and infighting. Her response: \u201cDunno.\u201d That wasn\u2019t quite good enough for me. I responded:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know your own reaction? None of us know how it will turn out of course.

I tried to explain how it looked to me \u2014 and perhaps to her friend. To many people, this president\u2019s sloppy speech about nuclear weapons, his failure to promptly condemn violence by white supremacists, his lack of ethics and so on was particularly troubling. Supporting him meant condoning that. \u201cI thought them mostly angry and misguided,\u201d I wrote. \u201cYou knew you were among the reviled.\u201d\n\nShe wrote back, in defense:\n\n\u201cIt means I thought (think) he has the right idea. I believe Congress could implement his ideas humanely \u2014 his articulation is lacking. He is not a one-man show. I want him to do the job.

If there was no catastrophe in the first year, the possibility of one in the second was ratcheted up, from North Korea to Iran. In the National Security Strategy published in December, the subheading under \u201cDiplomacy and Statecraft\u201d is \u201cCompetitive Diplomacy\u201d \u2014 not cooperation. Money is apparently no object to ensure \u201cweapons systems that clearly overmatch\u201d in \u201clethality.\u201d Diplomacy, by contrast, requires \u201cefficient use of limited resources.\u201d The evisceration of the State Department and big increases in military budgets reflect Trump\u2019s mind-set.\n\nHis nuclear brinkmanship with North Korea seems to involve a belief that nuclear war might just be feasible as a means, short of a blood bath, to bloody Kim Jong-un\u2019s nose. That \u2014 and I\u2019m being charitable \u2014 is hard to imagine. Limited nuclear war is a near oxymoron. It is not inconceivable, however, especially if Trump begins to feel cornered by the Russia investigation and in need of a foreign policy surprise. New lower-yield nuclear weapons, whose threshold for use might be lower, are contemplated in the Pentagon\u2019s draft Nuclear Posture Review. The surprise could also come with Iran. The president\u2019s foolish undermining of the Iran nuclear deal is perverse. If North Korea could have been stopped short of a bomb, as Iran has been, even Trump\u2019s White House would be happy.\n\nBut Trump is deaf to reason. He talks of revived American greatness. Yet, as president, he has not set foot in California, where American technology and innovation create companies that capture the world\u2019s imagination. All that interests him is that Californians tend to dislike him. Disrespect, whether domestic or foreign, is intolerable to him.\n\nA global power shift long preceded Trump; China\u2019s share of global output rose to about 15 percent from less than 4 percent in the past two decades. The Obama presidency talked down American greatness. In Syria, Barack Obama\u2019s abdication was complete. But through dereliction, President Trump has fast-forwarded this American retreat.\n\nOf course, mistrust of America\u2019s rivals is not misplaced. Russia and China, ideological foes, are in an assertive and expansionist mood. Russia has won in Syria. It has not retreated in Ukraine. European nations, including Hungary, have proved susceptible to Vladimir Putin\u2019s democratic authoritarianism. Russian cyberattacks on Western democracies have proved disruptive, especially in the United States.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping of China, in a speech late last year, offered his nation\u2019s model as \u201ca new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.\u201d This amounted to a remarkable expression of self-confidence. It is of a piece with the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, an attempt to weave other countries\u2019 fates into China\u2019s growing ambitions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the Cold War demonstrated, such challenges to American interests are best confronted through coherent strategy backed by a credible threat of force and a clear set of values. This, however, is not Trump\u2019s thing. Value-free outbursts are. The president is \u201cso boxed in on Russia that he\u2019s deprived of any ability to conduct a policy, and that paralysis is dangerous,\u201d Jonathan Eyal, a London-based strategic analyst, told me. On nuclear weapons and on Syria, the United States has no mechanism for dialogue with Russia at the highest level because Trump is frozen in genuflection to Putin, his own National Security Strategy notwithstanding.\n\nWith China, too, policy has veered: trade bellicosity one moment, blandishments designed to enlist Beijing\u2019s help in squeezing North Korea the next. Xi, deploying pomp and flattery during the president\u2019s visit last year, knows how to get Trump where he wants him. America First makes China look like the more responsible global power. Tillerson labors to open diplomatic channels to Pyongyang; Trump tells his secretary of state he\u2019s \u201cwasting his time.\u201d In the end the confidence of both China and Russia is buttressed by Trump\u2019s wackiness and compromised hesitations.\n\nLast September, Trump met with Emmanuel Macron, the young president of France, who, unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, has a relationship with him. Syria came up. Trump said he\u2019d hit Syria with 50 missiles after the chemical-weapons infringement. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked his aides who, in cowering unison, confirmed he had. Iran came up. Macron, like other European leaders, is concerned that the nuclear deal Trump opposes be upheld. Trump was uninterested. He veered off on a bizarre tangent about the trade France does with Iran.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to do business with Trump \u2014 not least for those who serve him. This month offered the extraordinary spectacle of the United States ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, rebuffing Trump over the new American Embassy that the president had described as being in an \u201coff location\u201d and costing $1.2 billion. It didn\u2019t \u201ccost the U.S. taxpayer a cent,\u201d Johnson retorted. Trump was really looking for a reason to cancel a British trip that would have provoked protests. It has come to this: an American president who\u2019s unwelcome in London!\n\nThe unthinkable is now commonplace. Perhaps that\u2019s what Trump wanted above all: to shake up Western complacency over how the world could, and could not, be run. That\u2019s not a bad thing. The anger he intuited among the losers from globalization was real. His words have been worse than his deeds. The global economy is purring. The terrorists of the Islamic State have taken a devastating blow. In a best-case scenario, his wild North Korean threats are just a bad-cop show.\n\nBut something terrible, and perhaps irreparable, has happened. The idea of America has been sullied. It has fallen victim to Trump\u2019s untruth, indecency, racism and contempt for the values without which American greatness is inconceivable. The president is at home with despots because he sees himself in them.\n\nWolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to Washington, told me: \u201cI cannot explain to my 13-year-old daughter, who was born in the United States, that for her, President Trump should be the symbol of the values we stand for: human dignity, personal freedom and so on. A fundamental anchor has been lost.\u201d\n\nThe disarray Trump has engendered reflects the degree to which he has turned the meaning of the word \u201cAmerica\u201d on its head. He has empowered bigots, thugs, bullies, racists, nationalists and nativists the world over.\n\nIn Israel, I asked Hannah Pollin-Galay, a senior lecturer in Yiddish literature at Tel Aviv University, what she thought of Trump\u2019s Jerusalem declaration. \u201cIt destroyed hope on both sides,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives right-wing nationalists the stage and sense they are right. Look! The rightist strategy works. You are rewarded for not listening to the Palestinians, for not sharing holy ground. That is disastrous, the most dangerous thing imaginable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGramsci thought the perilous interregnum between world orders was a time of \u201cthe most varied morbid symptoms.\u201d Trump\u2019s second year will show whether those he has unleashed, and nurses within himself, can still be contained short of what he calls \u201cfire and fury.\u201d", "title": "Op-Ed Columnist: Year One in Donald Trump\u2019s World", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/opinion/sunday/trump-first-year.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:30:01Z"}, {"textData": "He is cognizant and curious about morality and ethics, at the level of preschool behaviors, parent-child negotiations, apocalyptic superhero conflicts and science fiction wars.

I taught my son the face and name of the man who is president, along with a few negative words for him. That was wrong. Not just for the sake of the person who is president, and for all the people who voted for him, but for my own sake. To call someone else stupid is to release anger, bitterness and vitriol into my own bloodstream, poisoning me.

Let me empathize with him, so that I can understand him and feel for him as a human being, even as I oppose him in almost all matters.\n\nA meal I shared with a Vietnamese-American Buddhist monk provoked some of this thinking. At the end of our meal, we closed our eyes and meditated, focused on our breathing, on the passage of air over our upper lips, on the stillness within ourselves.\n\nI listened to his steady, quiet voice guide me and my breathing.

What have I learned from our relationship this year? That we must believe in what is good and right, without demonizing those that we oppose; that we must fight for what we believe in, without recourse to hate or insults; that we must give, in ways great and small, to distant organizations and the people we meet face to face; that we must connect to others who believe as we do, and grow our values and our organizations; that we must write and read what is meaningful, and ignore the morass of public opinion and media-induced emotions.\n\nIf we all do this, perhaps we can change our country, even in the face of entrenched power, the oligarchy of billionaires, the fear and hatred of those who feel powerless. It will take years to stop the tax cuts and the environmental assault, and it may take forever to stop our forever wars and to dismantle racism and patriarchy.

They met at a party, which led to a dinner date, which led to a sexual encounter that she came to deeply regret, she told a reporter, believing Mr. Ansari ignored verbal and nonverbal cues that she wasn\u2019t into what was happening. Now that she has gone public with her account, everyone seems to have an opinion about what she did, what he did and whether talking about gray-zone sex, where the man believes that everything that happened was consensual and the woman feels otherwise, spells the end of the #MeToo movement.\n\nReading about it all, I realize how lucky I am that so much of my sex ed came from Harlequins.\n\nThe literary establishment doesn\u2019t have much love for women\u2019s fiction, whether it\u2019s romance or erotica or popular novels about love and marriage. Romance novels come in for an extra helping of scorn. Critics sneer that they\u2019re all heaving bosoms and throbbing manhoods, unrealistic, poorly written and politically incorrect.\n\nBut those books, for all their soft-core covers and happily-ever-afters, were quietly and not-so-quietly subversive. They taught readers that sexual pleasure was something women could not just hope for but insist upon. They shaped my interactions with boys and men. They helped make me a feminist.\n\nBecause these books were written for and consumed by women, female pleasure was an essential part of every story. Villains were easy to spot: They were the ones who left a woman \u201cburning and unsatisfied.\u201d Shirley Conran\u2019s \u201cLace\u201d features a heroine telling her feckless husband that she\u2019d used an egg timer to determine how long it took her to achieve orgasm on her own and that she\u2019d be happy to teach him what to do.\n\nAt 14, I never looked at hard-boiled eggs the same way again.\n\nThe books not only covered blissful sex but also described a whole range of intimate moments, from the awkward to the funny to the very bad, including rape of both the stranger and intimate-partner variety. Beyond the dirty bits, the books I read described the moments before and after the main event, the stuff you don\u2019t see in mainstream movies, where zippers don\u2019t get stuck and teeth don\u2019t bump when you\u2019re kissing; the stuff you don\u2019t see in porn, where almost no time elapses between the repair guy\u2019s arrival and the start of activities that do not involve the clogged kitchen sink.\n\nObjectification doesn\u2019t exist just in porn, of course. \u201cSo many men cannot get their heads around the idea that women are not first and foremost sexual objects,\u201d the novelist Jenny Crusie told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that from porn; you get that from a persistent worldview modeled by the men around you that you\u2019ve been taught to admire.\u201d\n\nI have no idea how much, if any, X-rated material Mr. Ansari or his date consumes. Statistically, we know that modern men and women have access to every kind of explicit material, literally in their pockets. And they\u2019re watching: One recent study found that 79 percent of men and 76 percent of women between 18 and 30 look at pornographic websites at least once each month, while another showed that three out of 10 men in that age group were daily viewers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSex might be easy, but relationships are hard. And a 400-page novel can teach you more about them than any X-rated clip. Fiction has time to draw a deeper picture, covering the getting-to-know-you stuff, the starts and stops and circling back that take boy and girl from first date to first kiss to the moment where they\u2019re both naked and hopefully into what\u2019s going to happen next.\n\n\u201cRomance novels teach readers that all partners are equal participants in a sexual relationship,\u201d said Bea Koch, the 28-year-old co-owner (with her 25-year-old sister, Leah) of the Ripped Bodice, a bookstore in Culver City, Calif., that exclusively sells romance titles. \u201cThey highlight conversations about consent, birth control and myriad other topics that people generally find difficult to talk about. In some instances, it can be a literal script for how to bring up difficult topics with a partner. They give a road map to people wanting to experiment with their sexuality, or even just get in touch with what they want and need in a sexual relationship.\u201d\n\nPorn, necessarily, cuts to the chase: a little less conversation, a little more action.\n\nTalking\u2019s not sexy, people complain.\n\nBut when you don\u2019t know how to ask, when you can\u2019t bring yourself to tell, when you don\u2019t possess the language with which to talk about desire, that\u2019s when you can end up with crossed wires, missed signals, mixed messages, a guy who goes to sleep thinking, \u201cThat was fun!\u201d and a girl who goes home crying in an Uber.\n\nIf we want men and women equally empowered to form real connections, to talk, honestly and openly about who they are and what they want, there are worse places to start than curling up with a good book.", "title": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer: We Need Bodice-Ripper Sex Ed", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/opinion/sunday/romance-novels-sex-ed.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:30:01Z"}, {"textData": "So as a counterpoint to Frum\u2019s argument for tragedy, let me make the case for farce. Start with the central issue that disturbs many patriotic critics of our president: that Trump was elected with covert assistance from Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, that he or his allies may have cooperated with Putin\u2019s attempted sabotage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and that some combination of sympathy for Putinism, a debt to Russian hackers, and even some sort of kompromat make him effectively a Manchurian president.\n\nFrum, like others, has a moral certainty about the depth of Trumpian collusion that I don\u2019t see vindicated in the publicly available facts. But it is certainly imaginable that Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation will reveal something truly damning and impeachable.\n\nBut whatever the offenses may be, the real-world policy effects that Trump\u2019s critics have feared from l\u2019Affaire Russe \u2014 an alliance of strongmen, the subordination of American interests to Moscow, the unraveling of NATO \u2014 haven\u2019t materialized at all. Trump may desire a d\u00e9tente, but instead we are escalating our proxy war with Russia in Ukraine even as sanctions remain in force and our troops train in Eastern Europe and the Pentagon\u2019s National Security Strategy treats Moscow as a major threat. If Trump is supposed to be advancing Kremlin interests from Washington, the bargain isn\u2019t working, and the Russians might as well just release the pee tape and have done with it.\n\nAnd what\u2019s true with Russia is true on other fronts. A vast gulf between the things Trump says he wants \u2014 which are, indeed, often authoritarian \u2014 and the things that actually happen is the essential characteristic of his presidency\u2019s first year.\n\nHe promised to bring back waterboarding and worse; he was easily talked out of it. He promised a Muslim ban; a much more modest travel ban is now tied up in the courts. He launched a voter fraud commission, which his critics regarded as a step toward massive vote suppression; it was ineffective and broke up. He keeps threatening to change the libel laws; they aren\u2019t changing, and the anti-Trump press is thriving. NATO and Nafta are both still there; the trade war with China has been postponed; we are not at war with Iran or (yes, I know, yet) with North Korea; the scope of the Russia investigation has only widened since Trump\u2019s hamfisted intervention.\n\nBefore Trump took office, it was reasonable to worry that he would fill high offices with cronies, but the real cranks have rarely lasted and many appointments have been reasonable and conventional and even boring. The president is filling the courts with Federalist Society conservatives, not his sister or Ivanka or Newt Gingrich, and his cabinet looks a lot like a generic Republican administration, whose efforts liberals understandably oppose and sometimes deplore, but which are not remotely like the workings of a fascist cabal circa 1935.\n\nAnd then legislatively, the story of the Trump era so far is failure on every front save tax cuts, an outsourcing of policymaking to Hill Republicans, and a general incompetence that is bringing us yet another government shutdown. The recurrence of these shutdowns is, certainly, a symptom of the republic\u2019s sclerosis \u2014 but it is not a Trump-specific problem, and he seems to have made it neither better nor much worse.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow it might be argued that all of this \u2014 the balking of Trump\u2019s authoritarian impulses, the normalcy of his appointments, his massive unpopularity and legislative failures \u2014 is due to the intense vigilance of the Resistance, the widespread determination to treat this president as an existential threat.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. Senate Republicans succeeded in normalizing Trump\u2019s cabinet and judicial appointments by behaving, well, normally: Working behind the scenes to veto bad choices and elevate more conventional picks. Congressional Democrats have stalled Trump\u2019s agenda by campaigning against its substance, as they would with any other G.O.P. president, and they are threatening to take the House and Senate by running no-fuss-and-drama candidates. The Deep State of bureaucrats and generals has prevented sudden breaks with U.S. policy not with high-profile resignations or massive acts of sabotage, but by repeatedly, patiently talking the president out of his most disruptive or dangerous ideas.\n\nAnd where an abnormal response to Trump has kept things on an even keel, it hasn\u2019t been furious protests; rather, it\u2019s been a collective decision by many different actors, from his own appointees to his congressional opponents to foreign leaders the world over, to simply behave as if he isn\u2019t actually the president, as if the system around him is what matters, and his expressed desires are just a reality TV performance.\n\nThis is not how a truly dangerous authoritarianism works. It\u2019s not how the imperial presidencies of the past worked, either: For all his braggart\u2019s talk, Trump has done nothing that compares with the power grabs and norm violations of Woodrow Wilson or Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon, George W. Bush or even Barack Obama \u2026 and because he lacks the popularity or media adulation that all of those presidents enjoyed at one point, it\u2019s very hard to see how he would go about imitating them.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that his presidency is succeeding, or that NeverTrumpers were wrong to oppose him; it doesn\u2019t mean that his manifest incapacity won\u2019t lead to some disaster; it doesn\u2019t mean that conservatives or anyone else should be happy to have porn stars and race-baiting in the headlines; it doesn\u2019t mean that the Trump chapter in our history won\u2019t be remembered for hastening decline.\n\nBut if this chapter is a prelude to an authoritarian future, that future has clearly not yet arrived. Trump is a dictator on Twitter, a Dear Leader in his own mind, but in the real world there is no Trumpocracy because Trump cannot even rule himself.

Kendi notes that Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson said racist things at various points in their lives. But the important thing is that both men overcame their earlier sentiments to eventually free the slaves (Lincoln) and sign comprehensive civil rights legislation that included protection of voting rights (Johnson). In both cases, these men decided that they loved the ideals \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d with such conviction that they overcame their inner demons. Then they acted on their conviction. It is important what they did, not what they said.\n\nNEIL CAREY, ANNANDALE, VA.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIbram X. Kendi did an incredibly succinct job of highlighting the disconnect between racist ideologies and the perpetrators of these ideologies who refuse to admit to participating in the first place. Senator Richard Durbin\u2019s take on President Trump\u2019s comments about Haiti and Africa as being \u201chate-filled, vile and racist\u201d is well founded. As presidential scandal after scandal cycles through the news like clockwork, we are drawn to the conclusion that Mr. Trump is the worst thing to happen to the Oval Office in American history.\n\nGranted, his presidency is definitely high on that scale. But when we take a step back and look in the greater context of American politics, we see a troubling trend. As Mr. Kendi reminds us, eight presidents owned slaves while in office. Lyndon B. Johnson said the N-word repeatedly, and even Abraham Lincoln was guilty of bigotry. Racism, and repeated denial of such beliefs, have been an integral part of our government since its founding, as much as we might try to deny it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEMILY GETNER, CHICAGO\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs a cultural anthropologist and educator, I accept the premise that ethnocentrism and racism are universal human traits. Given this, it is simply natural that at one level all of us are racists and all of us have certain innate tribal tendencies. However, at the same time human beings have the capacity to understand that skin color is not a legitimate or even practical means of measuring or comparing individual human worth, character or potential. This assumption lies at the heart of modern democracy, the American Constitution and an efficient global economy.\n\nIf indeed at one level all of us are born with racist tendencies, feeling a natural preference for those who look like us, then what does it mean to be called a \u201cracist\u201d? Unfortunately, it is a descriptor that has been used so often in recent years that it has lost its meaning. The fact is there is a condition in some Americans, including our president, that runs much deeper than simple \u201cracism,\u201d a condition that causes them to debase people of color with impunity. It makes individuals seem oblivious to the regressive nature and sheer cruelty of their actions.\n\nYes, this is racism, but also something much more serious. It is what I would call \u201cpathobigotry,\u201d a mental condition born of one\u2019s own feelings of inadequacy that drives one to degrade and consciously discriminate against others who are different as a means of bolstering one\u2019s own sense of self-worth.\n\nI think it is time we start calling Donald Trump what he is. A racist, yes, but more seriously a \u201cpathobigot.\u201d He needs help.\n\nKENDALL BLANCHARD\n\nLENEXA, KAN.\n\nThe writer is a former president of Georgia Southwestern State University.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cNo One Is Coming to Save Us From Trump\u2019s Racism\u201d (Op-Ed, Jan. 13):\n\nRoxane Gay aptly urges us to \u201csit with\u201d this moment of \u201csorrow, distress, and humiliation\u201d rather than trying to get past it. She emphasizes that President Trump\u2019s recent racist comments reflect the racism that has always been present and that even well-meaning attempts to overcome this racism will likely not be effective while Mr. Trump remains president. She is emphasizing the need for us to be self-reflective about the existence of racism.\n\nAnd Ibram X. Kendi passionately argues that we in America are in denial about the racism that exists in our country.\n\nWe would do well to heed the thoughtful comments of both Ms. Gay and Mr. Kendi. We must all, individually and collectively, confront our racism as a first step in overcoming the social injustice and inequality in America.

The U.S. government officially entered a partial shutdown early Saturday as Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans blocked a bill to fund the government. The two parties failed to break a deadlock over immigration. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nThe U.S. military faced a variety of consequences as a result of a federal government shutdown Saturday, with U.S. troops working at least temporarily without pay, thousands of civilian employees furloughed and Republicans and Democrats alike saying that their opponents should do better for the troops.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis said in a memo released by the Pentagon on Saturday that the U.S. military will continue to carry out operations across the world, but the shutdown already was prompting the cancellation or delay of training for reserve units and having other effects. Mattis pledged to do his best to mitigate disruptions and financial impact on military families.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to execute daily operations around the world \u2014 ships and submarines will remain at sea, our aircraft will continue to fly and our warfighters will continue to pursue terrorists throughout the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia,\u201d Mattis wrote. \u201cWhile training for reservists must be curtailed, active forces will stay at their posts adapting their training to achieve the least negative impact on our readiness to fight.\u201d\n\nMattis added: \u201cSteady as she goes \u2014 hold the line. I know our Nation can count on you.\u201d\n\nThe president says the military could be shut down if the government isn't funded, but all active-duty personnel would stay on the job. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nAccording to a Pentagon planning memo posted this week, all active duty uniformed personnel are to continue their duties, but they will not be paid until after the shutdown is resolved.\n\nCol. John Thomas, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the shutdown would not have a significant impact across the Middle East, where U.S. troops are conducting operations against militants in Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere, and where the U.S. military has a host of major bases.\n\nPresident Trump accused the Democrats on Saturday morning in a tweet of \u201cholding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration,\u201d a reference to the dispute that is at the heart of the shutdown.\n\nDemocrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can\u2019t let that happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2018\n\nBut the situation wasn\u2019t that simple. While Trump, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republicans blamed the Democrats, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) made an effort shortly after midnight to get the troops\u2019 salaries and death benefits paid through the shutdown.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that tonight we send a very clear signal that we don\u2019t want one moment to pass with there being any uncertainty of any soldier anywhere in the world that they will be paid for the valiant work they do for our national security,\u201d McCaskill said, calling for a resolution to pay the troops.\n\nMcConnell scuttled the effort, objecting to her motion.\n\nEarly this morning, @clairecmc tried to pass a bill to guarantee military pay and death benefits in the #TrumpShutdown.\n\nRepublican Leader Mitch McConnell: I object. WATCH: pic.twitter.com/n3a7RBaxzi \u2014 Senate Democrats (@SenateDems) January 20, 2018\n\nThe pay situation threatened the financial well-being of service members, whose annual salaries begin at less than $30,000. As McCaskill noted, Congress has historically given the military back pay when a shutdown occurs or passed a bill that pays them during a work stoppage. U.S. troops are paid twice a month, and the next check is expected Feb. 1.\n\nAs Mattis predicted in public remarks Friday, military reservists across the country traveled in preparation for scheduled training this weekend, only to be sent home after the shutdown at midnight. While some live close to their units, it\u2019s common for reservists to travel several hours to bases for drilling.\n\nBryan Salas, a Marine Corps veteran, said his son traveled from West Virginia on Friday to report to training this weekend at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Va., but returned hours later.\n\n\u201cHe just went back to West Virginia about a half-hour ago,\u201d Salas said around noon Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s just time wasted. He\u2019s a student, but there are others who have jobs and their own businesses who planned for this training.\u201d\n\nA soldier assigned to the Army\u2019s 450th Civil Affairs Battalion in Maryland said that his unit is preparing for a month-long exercise in March, and was planning to work on weapons qualifications this weekend in advance. The battalion includes numerous congressional staff members, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have dozens of mission-planning tasks to complete since we just got our initial operations order for the exercise on Thursday,\u201d said the soldier, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to be candid. \u201cNot to mention all the equipment that needs to be prepared to move by rail. This puts us really far behind with only two days scheduled in February to prepare for a month-long training.\u201d\n\nWhile uniformed personnel are largely shielded from the shutdown\u2019s effects, civilian employees whose jobs are not deemed critical to defense operations will be furloughed, according to the same Pentagon memo.\n\nThere are more than 740,000 Defense Department civilians. Mattis said Friday that about half of them would be furloughed. The Defense Department did not respond to repeated requests on Saturday to provide a precise number of furloughed employees.\n\nSusanna Blume, who was a Pentagon official at the time of the last shutdown in 2013, said Pentagon leaders may not actually know that number, because decisions about which civilian employees will stay home are often delegated down the bureaucracy, and the roster of furloughed personnel can change day to day given work requirements.\n\nFormer officials said that the impact of the shutdown, especially if it goes on for an extended of period of time, may be felt most keenly in military readiness because of its effect on civilian or reserve personnel involved in maintenance and training.\n\n\u201cDisrupting those schedules often has a domino effect,\u201d Blume said. Military intelligence activities, which often rely on civilian personnel, could also be affected, she said.\n\nMark Cancian, who was a senior budget official in 2013, suggested that if lawmakers resolve the impasse in a matter of days, the episode would be \u201cdisruptive but not catastrophic.\u201d Even so, he said, the act of planning for a shutdown would cost taxpayers millions of dollars.\n\nAlready on Saturday, other effects were felt across the military. One particularly sensitive one is the temporary suspension of $100,000 payments promised to military families in the event their loved one dies so that they can travel and prepare funerals. Several nonprofits, including Fisher House and the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), offered to assist families that might be in need.\n\nThe Armed Forces Network, which carries television broadcasts of sporting events and other programming, was taken off air at midnight, leaving deployed U.S. troops without one common way to watch National Football League playoff games this weekend.\n\nDefense Department outreach efforts also were curtailed, including aerial flyovers at sporting events, band performances and related travel, according to a memo by Dana W. White, Mattis\u2019s assistant for public affairs.\n\nWhile duties performed by uniformed personnel overseas are not immediately affected, the signal sent to troops in areas such as U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), where forces are deployed under hazardous conditions in Somalia, Niger and elsewhere, did not appear to be a welcome one.\n\n\u201cWe hope Congress has our country\u2019s best interest in mind,\u201d said Col. Mark Cheadle, an AFRICOM spokesman, when asked about the shutdown.\n\nMissy Ryan contributed to this report.", "title": "Amid government shutdown, the military becomes a centerpiece of political jabs - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2018/01/20/amid-government-shutdown-the-military-becomes-a-centerpiece-to-make-political-jabs/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:22:54Z"}, {"textData": "It was 45 years ago Monday \u2014 on Jan. 22, 1973 \u2014 that the U.S. Supreme Court announced its 7-2 decision in Roe v. Wade: that a woman\u2019s constitutional right to privacy extended to decisions about whether to terminate a pregnancy, thus essentially declaring that laws prohibiting abortion were unconstitutional.\n\nBut, rather than closing the book on the issue, the ruling opened a Pandora\u2019s box.\n\nAnd it remains open to this day. On Thursday, the Trump administration revealed its plan to create a federal office that would protect medical providers who refuse to participate in abortion procedures. The next day, the White House declared the Roe anniversary to be National Sanctity of Human Life Day, and President Trump became the first sitting president to address the March for Life rally, the major anti-abortion gathering that\u2019s been held annually since the first anniversary of Roe. And on Saturday, reproductive rights are sure to be a topic of discussion among the many who are marching nationwide in an encore of last year\u2019s Women\u2019s March.\n\nOne person with a unique perspective on the aftermath of Roe is lawyer Sarah Weddington, 72, of Austin. When she was just 26, in what would be one of several milestones in her legal career, she argued on behalf of \u201cJane Roe\u201d (later revealed to be Norma McCorvey) in the famous suit. TIME has caught up with Weddington to mark the Roe anniversary before, a tradition of sorts that continued this week. Below is an edited transcript of that conversation.\n\n\n\nTIME: This week, President Trump made headlines with announcements and appearances in support of the \u201canti\u201d side in the fight over abortion in the U.S. What does it mean that the President is taking such a stance, 45 years after the Supreme Court addressed the issue?\n\nWEDDINGTON: It\u2019s not anything we didn\u2019t expect, and what it really means I don\u2019t know. Most of us have known that he\u2019s [Trump\u2019s] very anti-abortion, that his Attorney General is very anti-abortion, his Vice President is very anti-abortion, so it just means we\u2019re going to have to fight harder. It\u2019s a help in the sense that it puts a flag for people who care about the difficult situation we\u2019re in. Now they cannot make abortion illegal, given Roe v. Wade, but if they had more justices willing to try to overturn Roe v. Wade, then that would become an even bigger problem. Right now they don\u2019t have enough justices to do that, and thank goodness Ruth Bader Ginsburg does her exercises.\n\nI look back at the time [around] Roe v. Wade, and you had Barry Goldwater who was very Republican but very pro-choice. Then you had Ford as president and his wife Betty Ford, who was very pro-choice. So I guess what\u2019s really changed is that now you\u2019ve got so many more Republicans who are very anti-choice, whereas 40 years ago, you had a lot of Republicans who were very pro-choice.\n\nToday, abortion rates in the U.S. are at their lowest since the Roe v. Wade ruling. How do you see that development?\n\nAt the time of Roe v. Wade, when we started it, the health center at the University of Texas did not provide any counseling about contraception or about contraceptives, so I do think you\u2019ve got a lot more people trying to prevent pregnancy [today], and so you don\u2019t have as many abortions as you did at a time when contraception was very hard to have access to.\n\n[And] since they can\u2019t make abortion illegal right now, you\u2019ll see the center of litigation in recent years has been all these measures passed in various states trying to make abortion unavailable. Some of that has been measures to say that no place can perform abortion unless they have hallways wide enough for two gurneys to go down the aisle, and then they\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, we do this for women\u2019s protection, so it will be safer for women.\u201d I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with their concern about women. I think it\u2019s all their concern about how can they keep abortion from being available.\n\nHow did the spirit of the women\u2019s movement, in the years leading up to Roe, factor into your decision to take on this case?\n\nNot directly. That was a time, particularly here in Austin, when there were a lot of women who were very involved in various protests movements. Once a group of students, mostly grad students in sciences, found out that the University of Texas\u2019s health center didn\u2019t provide contraception or contraceptive information, they decided they would be volunteers to give women more information. So a couple of them went to New York to go get the book Our Bodies, Ourselves that was printed in New York and Boston. They used it as the basis for some of the information they were sharing.\n\nThen the women would come and say, \u201cBut I\u2019m already pregnant. I don\u2019t want to go through this. Where can I get an abortion?\u201d So [the volunteers] started going through the research on where could women go for abortions, and at that point California was legal. There was a flight on American Airlines every Thursday. Usually about ten women would be on that plane going to California for abortions. But you had to have money for the plane, you had to have money for the procedure, and so there was a need for money to help women who didn\u2019t have enough themselves. We used to raise money through garage sales.\n\nYou told TIME in 2003 that the \u201870s were a really great time for activist women and that young women haven\u2019t faced the same resistance today that women had back then \u2014\n\n\n\nI still feel strongly that it was partially when women were told \u201cwomen can\u2019t, women shouldn\u2019t, women don\u2019t,\u201d a lot of women thought, \u201cYou just watch.\u201d\n\nI said to the dean of the little college I went to that I wanted to go to law school, and he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. No woman from this college has ever gone to law school. It would be too tough.\u201d When I went, I think there were five women in my beginning class. Some of the professors wouldn\u2019t let women into a class because that would be wasting time and effort on someone who would never really use the education. Another wouldn\u2019t let women ask questions. They could only ask questions one day a semester. That\u2019s changed dramatically now. Last year, there were more women in law school than men.\n\nBut do you still feel that way today, in light of the Women\u2019s March, the #MeToo movement and the unprecedented surge of first-time female candidates?\n\nThere was an article talking about various things where you\u2019ll have one group that says, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t use the term \u2018Women\u2019s March\u2019 here, we have the rights to use that,\u201d and other people are saying that doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. It just makes me realize that there have always been tensions within the women\u2019s movement. And there are still going to be tensions. We still have a long way to go, but I think the path is in the right direction.\n\nSo do you think #MeToo and these other women\u2019s movements will be lasting and bring real change?\n\nI do.\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nNorma McCorvey was very public about her change of heart about abortion later in life. How did you feel about her petitioning the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2005?\n\nClearly I wish she hadn\u2019t, but I\u2019m not going to be critical of her for what she did. I\u2019m certainly glad the Supreme Court did not agree to take the case where she was trying to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nShe was a changeable person. The problem I had was trying to tell when she was telling the truth and when she wasn\u2019t. For example, at one point she did an interview, and the reporter said to her, \u201cHow did you get pregnant?\u201d and she said, \u201cI was working for a sleazy carnival one night in rural Georgia, and I was walking back to the sleazy motel where I was staying, and three men\u2014a black, a white, and possibly a Hispanic\u2014had brutally raped me.\u201d Frankly I had always had concerns about that, because I don\u2019t think those three people would be together in rural Georgia in 1969. [In 1987, when a] very important black interviewer on TV said, \u201cWhat about the rape?\u201d She said, \u201cI lied.\u201d She took after the Trump method of truthfulness, which was say whatever you want to.\n\nDid you worry about whether that would affect how people in the future would see the case?\n\nI was very careful in drafting the materials that were filed with the court to be sure I only put in things I was sure were accurate.\n\nThen why was she picked to be the plaintiff?\n\nFirst, she was pregnant, and the case was a class action, not just for her but on behalf of all women, who will or might become pregnant and want the choice of abortion. Second, she had already had a child that her mother took away from her on the basis that she was unfit to raise the child. So the main things we were alleging were she was pregnant, she didn\u2019t want to be, and that she was not in a position to really raise a child. And she felt very willing\u2014as far we could tell\u2014to be the plaintiff in the case, especially when we explained that we were not requiring any money from her and that she could be anonymous. And so we never made her name public. She decided to do that at some later time.\n\nHow does this anniversary feel compared to past landmark anniversaries?\n\nWhen I started the case, the research in 1969, if anybody had said, \u2018You will still be talking about this in 45 years,\u2019 I would not have believed that. And so what I\u2019m most amazed at is how long the issue has still been at the center of a lot of political conversations, because if I look back at the case that dealt with contraception decided in 1965, Griswold v. Connecticut, my memory is it took a few years for people to come to a general agreement that government wasn\u2019t going to get to decide whether they could use birth control. [I thought] it would be some years before people sort of came to a common agreement that it was not the government\u2019s business to decide women\u2019s reproductive freedom. I\u2019ve been surprised at how long it has really taken.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long it will take, but at some point, I\u2019m not going to be willing to keep talking to anyone who asks me to do an interview. There\u2019s a point at which you just get tired of that. It takes up a lot of my time, which, of course, is always pro bono. I did the case for free. At some point I am just tired of doing it, but I think the issue is so important. Soon, a younger generation, younger women and men in law school, are going to have to take on that responsibility.", "title": "Roe v.

It\u2019s Kim who\u2019s decided when the Koreas will talk and what they will talk about.\n\nAs for President Trump? Well, he could be said to be in the back, going along for the ride.\n\nAs South Korea presses ahead with efforts to bring a large North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang next month, it is willingly agreeing to North Korea\u2019s demands.\n\nBut Trump, a former businessman who prides himself on being a masterful negotiator, is claiming \u2014 and getting \u2014 most of the credit for the sudden burst of Olympics-related diplomacy between the two Koreas.\n\nDuring a Jan. 4 phone call in which the South Korean leader briefed the American president on the plans for talks with North Korea, Trump asked Moon to publicly give him the credit for creating the environment for the talks, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\n(In these conversations, Trump calls his counterpart \u201cJae-in\u201d \u2014 an unimaginable informality in Korean business etiquette. Moon calls Trump \u201cMr. President.\u201d)\n\nLater that night, Trump tweeted that the talks wouldn\u2019t be happening \u201cif I wasn\u2019t firm, strong and willing to commit our total \u2018might\u2019 against the North.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference six days later, Moon agreed Trump deserved \u201chuge credit\u201d for the talks.\n\n[South Korean president credits Trump with bringing North Korea to the table]\n\nMoon is trying to manipulate Trump into effectively undermining his own policy: putting pressure on North Korea, said one former official, asking for anonymity to protect officials still in government.\n\n\u201cKim Jong Un is setting the agenda here,\u201d the former official said. \u201cHis purpose is to use these talks to show the world that he\u2019s okay and to make the sanctions effort lose steam.\u201d\n\nSince taking office last May, Moon has repeatedly made overtures to North Korea but Kim consistently rebuffed them all \u2014 until New Year\u2019s Day, that is. Then, just weeks after declaring that his nuclear weapons program was complete, the North Korean leader called for \u201cdetente\u201d with the South.\n\nThis prompted a flurry of activity in the South, including getting Trump to agree in that Jan. 4 phone call to postpone joint military drills until after the Olympics, to avoid antagonizing North Korea.\n\nFurther evidence of Kim\u2019s agenda-setting: The first item for discussion this week involved the performances of a North Korean propaganda orchestra known for numbers such as \u201cOur Comrade Kim Jong Un.\u201d Then came the inclusion of a 240-member cheering squad known as an \u201carmy of beauties\u201d because these squads have previously been made up entirely of attractive young women \u2014 and have been immensely popular in the South.\n\nThe South Korean government also agreed to combine the two Koreas\u2019 women\u2019s ice hockey teams \u2014 against the strong objections of the Southern team \u2014 and agreed to send Southern skiers to train on far inferior slopes in the North over the next few weeks.\n\nThe concessions to North Korea have angered many South Koreans, with some publicly wondering whether they\u2019re the PyeongChang or the Pyongyang games.\n\nMore than 31,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the president\u2019s office not to combine the hockey teams. \u201cPolitics should not be involved in sports. Is this a fair process, a just result?\u201d wrote one signer.\n\nA Realmeter poll published Thursday found that half of respondents thought the two Koreas should march separately under their own flags, while 40 percent supported this week\u2019s agreement that they should march together under a flag showing a unified Korean Peninsula.\n\n[Koreas plan Olympic first with joint women\u2019s hockey team. But many in the South are not happy.]\n\nHigh-ranking officials will come to South Korea as part of the Olympic delegation \u2014 including perhaps North Korea\u2019s de facto No. 2, Choe Ryong Hae. If he comes here, which would require his being removed from South Korea\u2019s sanctions list, Moon would hope to meet with him, according to aides.\n\nThe Moon administration is trying to build trust with the North in the hope this will lead to talks about its nuclear weapons program \u2014 although Kim\u2019s regime has made it clear that this is not an inter-Korean issue.\n\nThat process has gained extra urgency as Trump and his aides have talked increasingly about using military options to teach North Korea the error of its ways.\n\n\u201cWhen our government has talked to the Trump administration, we have always emphasized that the Olympics can be an excuse for North Korea to come out for talks,\u201d said Kim Hong-gul, the son of former South Korean president Kim Dae-jung, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for meeting Kim Jong Il in 2000. Kim Hong-gul met the current North Korean leader at Kim Jong Il\u2019s funeral in 2011 and is an influential voice on inter-Korean relations in the ruling Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cOur government has even more reason than ever to talk to North Korea because the stakes are now so much higher,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure war doesn\u2019t break out.\u201d\n\nThat could also be the reason for Kim Jong Un\u2019s change of heart, said Cheong Seong-chang, an expert on North Korea\u2019s leadership at the Sejong Institute near Seoul.\n\n\u201cKim Jong Un bragged about the nuclear button on his desk but he can\u2019t rule out the chance that the United States will resort to military options, so he might be trying to buy some time,\u201d Cheong said.\n\n[For North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, 2017 has been a very good year.]\n\nBut it could also be because international sanctions are starting to hurt. Regular visitors to North Korea say China has cracked down on border trade to a surprising extent, conducting thorough inspections of all goods going into and coming out of North Korea.\n\nIn the short term, this has made life better for the elite of Pyongyang: They are eating fresh fish and enjoying 24-hour electricity thanks to the bans on seafood and coal exports.\n\nThere are signs of stresses in the economy, including temporary blips in foreign exchange rates, the visitors say.\n\nThere are plenty of ways Moon\u2019s efforts could go off the rails.\n\nImmediately after the Olympics, South Korea and the United States are set to begin their postponed military drills, which in recent years have included practicing decapitation strikes on North Korea\u2019s leadership.\n\nChun Yung-woo, a hawkish national security adviser, said this short-term reprieve could lead to longer term problems.\n\n\u201cOnce all the diplomatic options have been exhausted,\u201d Chun said, \u201cMoon will have even fewer options left for dealing with North Korea.\u201d\n\nThat, analysts say, could embolden Trump aides like national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who argues that time for dealing with North Korea is running out. And it will be much harder then for Moon to flatter Trump into thinking otherwise.\n\nRead more:\n\nWill this North Korean band bring hits like \u2018Our Comrade Kim Jong Un\u2019 to South Korea?\n\nWhat does North Korea want from the Olympics?

In most places the rainfall was welcomed and did not cause any major flooding from burned or unburned hill slopes.\n\nBut in the town of Montecito, a coastal community in Santa Barbara County that lies at the foot of the mountains blackened by the Thomas Fire, a devastating set of sediment-laden flows killed at least 20 people and damaged or destroyed more than 500 homes.\n\nIn the popular press, these flows were termed \u201cmudslides,\u201d but with some rocks as large as cars, these are more accurately described as hyperconcentrated flows or debris flows, depending on the amount of sediment mixed with the water.\n\nWhy did these deadly flows happen? To what extent were these flows caused by the fire, the extreme burst of rainfall or a combination? And what can we do to reduce similar risks in the future?\n\nCauses of post-fire erosion\n\nSome reports have said that these post-fire flows are caused by the loss of vegetation, but as a scientist studying the effects of fires on soils, runoff and erosion, I can say this is not completely accurate. While many wildfires do burn trees and shrubs, the loss of this overlying vegetation canopy only slightly increases the amount of rainfall that reaches the soil surface and the kinetic energy delivered by the raindrops to the ground surface.\n\nThe far more important effect of high- and moderate-severity wildfires is that they can burn off all the surface litter and ground vegetation, leaving a layer of easily removed ash on top of otherwise bare soil.\n\nIn certain vegetation types, like chaparral and coniferous forests, fires will vaporize organic compounds found in the leaf litter. Some of these compounds are driven downward by the heat where they condense on cooler soil particles just below the surface. In sufficient quantity and especially in coarser-textured soils, the resulting water-repellent layer impedes the normal downward flow of water. Higher-severity fires also can consume some of the shallow soil organic matter that helps bind larger soil clumps.\n\nWhen winds and the first rains arrive, they quickly wash the ash away, and the impact of raindrops on the bare soil can detach and disperse small soil particles to create a surface seal or crust.\n\nThe net result is that after a high- or moderate-severity fire, the ability of the soil to absorb water decreases from around several inches per hour to perhaps just one-third of an inch per hour. Any additional rainfall becomes surface runoff, and a rainstorm of only one inch per hour can generate 1.5 million cubic feet of runoff per square mile.\n\nThe raindrops and surface runoff can easily erode and transport the unprotected soil on the hillsides. The resulting accumulation and concentration of flow and sediment in stream channels can rapidly mobilize rocks and soil.\n\nThe resulting mixture of water, eroded soil and rocks can quickly bulk up to a concentrated mix of water with 10 to 40 percent sediment or an even more concentrated and deadly debris flow moving at up to 20 miles per hour. Once these flows reach flatter areas or encounter obstacles, the velocity decreases and the rocks and mud are deposited.\n\nThe potential for such flows are exacerbated in much of Southern California because the mountains are steeper than normal due to rapid uplift along regional faults.\n\nWith population growth there are ever more houses and other developments at the base of mountains. Of greater concern is the placement of houses and other structures on the alluvial fans where streams have been depositing sediment and rapidly changing their course over many thousands of years.\n\nNo easy fixes\n\nWhen hill slopes are denuded of their surface soil cover by fire or other processes, the resulting increase in runoff and erosion is nearly inevitable. Mulch or other surface cover can be applied to help protect the soil from the raindrop impact, but mulching is difficult and expensive to quickly apply over large areas and is progressively ineffective on steeper slopes or during more intense storms that produce more surface runoff.\n\nDebris basins can be constructed to capture the runoff and sediment, but there are problems of finding locations and sizing their capacity for extreme events, as well clearing them before large storms.\n\nIn Montecito, an exceptional storm cell developed over a severely burned area, with nearly an inch of rain in just 15 minutes and more than half an inch in just five minutes. Montecito is particularly at risk as the hill slopes above town are oversteepened by faulting and rapid uplift, and much of the town is built on deposits laid down by previous floods.\n\nSome debris basins were in place, but they were quickly overtopped by the hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of water and sediment. While high post-fire runoff and erosion rates could be expected, it was not possible to accurately predict the exact location and extreme magnitude of this particular storm and resulting debris flows.\n\nThere is a long history of comparable post-fire debris flows in the Los Angeles area with a greater loss of life. Comparable events also have occurred elsewhere in the western United States, but in most cases the consequences have been much less tragic because wildfires more commonly occur in areas that are much less populated. This means the resultant effects are often limited to degraded water quality, loss of aquatic habitat and excess reservoir sedimentation.\n\nThe future\n\nLooking to the future, it is clear that the problem is only going to get worse.\n\nFirst, climate change is increasing the length and severity of the fire season by reducing snowpacks and increasing temperatures. Warmer temperatures increase fire risk as well as the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water, which is increasing rainfall intensities.\n\nSecond, a policy of suppressing wildfires has increased the amount and density of vegetation in some areas. This greater fuel load can result in higher severity fires and more denuded hill slopes. Future wildfires are inevitable, and when there are high temperatures, high winds, low humidity and large fuel loads, it is not possible to safely fight or control a large wildfire.\n\nNor is it possible to stop the subsequent hill-slope runoff and erosion. Debris basins or diversion structures can be built to reduce damage, but these are expensive and often do not have sufficient capacity for extreme post-fire storm events. While we are getting much better at predicting the risk of sediment-laden flows after wildfires through improved modeling and weather forecasting, the starting point has to be stricter zoning rules to minimize construction in vulnerable areas. And once an area does burn, residents must heed the calls for evacuation when post-fire rainstorms are predicted.\n\nRevegetation\n\nOn the positive side, most burned areas generally revegetate within two to four years. Once there is less than about 35 percent bare soil, there is a greatly reduced risk of high runoff and erosion rates.\n\nIn Montecito, the rapid delineation of risk zones led to the evacuations that undoubtedly helped save many hundreds of lives. What is now important is that the lessons from the Thomas Fire are applied in other areas to help minimize future losses of life and property. This is true in both the short term as more rain falls on the recently burned areas, and over the longer term given our increasingly fire-prone future.\n\nMacDonald is professor of ecosystem science and sustainability at Colorado State University.\n\nThis article was originally published on theconversation.com.", "title": "Those deadly mudslides you've read about?

They lost their Southerners to the Republicans, so they became more liberal. But they were not subsumed whole cloth by a liberal movement. There was no liberal movement to speak of in the 1990s. Indeed, there was an anti-liberal movement: the neoliberal, Third Way program that sought to distance itself from the old liberalism. The Democratic Party of today is still that coalition of liberal and center.\n\nSome statistics bear out the differences. In their important 2016 book \u201cAsymmetric Politics,\u201d the political scientists Matt Grossman and David A. Hopkins cite some research from roughly 2008 to 2014 showing that rank-and-file Republicans are much more ideologically demanding than Democrats. For example, nearly 60 percent of Republicans preferred \u201cideological purity\u201d to \u201cmoderation,\u201d whereas for Democrats that number was around 40 percent.\n\nIn addition, when asked to place themselves ideologically, 43 percent of Republicans said they were conservative, compared with only 20 percent of Democrats who called themselves liberal. In fact, more Democrats, 31 percent, said they were moderate. Just 19 percent of Republicans said so. Even about 10 percent of Democrats said they were conservative or slightly so. On the Republican side, the comparable numbers were negligible.\n\nThose numbers are telling. They describe two very different political parties. But \u2014 they\u2019re also a few years old. And I bet they\u2019re changing.\n\nThey started changing in the latter part of the Obama era, as rank-and-file Democrats became impatient for their party\u2019s leaders to endorse much bolder approaches to inequality and other economic challenges, an impatience that drove the enthusiasm behind Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign. And since Mr. Trump has been president, rank-and-file Democrats have become energized and aggressive in ways we\u2019ve not seen in 50 years.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Democrats\u2019 leader in the Senate, is not himself a to-the-barricades kind of guy. But in the wake of the 2016 election, he\u2019s been attuned to where things are headed. He added Mr. Sanders to an expanded leadership team. In last year\u2019s contest for a new chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Schumer backed Representative Keith Ellison, the favorite candidate of the Sanders wing.\n\nAnd now, he has led his party into a possibly risky government shutdown. It\u2019s not because he\u2019s a different person than he once was, or because he\u2019s somehow tougher than his predecessor, Harry Reid. It\u2019s because the Democratic base demands it, in a way that base would not have, I believe, a decade or so ago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor now, liberals should cheer this unreservedly. For one thing, the cause of these young undocumented Americans is a good one. But more broadly, the Republicans have been playing this way for years. If Democrats won\u2019t, they\u2019ll just lose. You can\u2019t bring a squirt gun to the O.K. Corral.\n\nAt the same time, there are longer-term concerns that citizens should keep in the back of their minds \u2014 not about the Democratic Party, but about the republic. I believe the Democrats are still several years away from becoming a movement party in the way the Republicans are. And it\u2019s not necessarily fated to happen, for a host of reasons, ranging from psychological differences between liberals and conservatives to the simple fact that there just aren\u2019t as many liberals in the United States as there are conservatives.\n\nBut if it were to happen \u2014 if we were to have two movement-subsumed parties \u2014 we would be in for some pretty big changes. We would move inexorably toward a more parliamentary system. New parties would pop up in the center \u2014 at least one, and I think probably two. Eventually the Constitution would get a revisit.

They slapped him and yanked his gray hair.\n\nIn March, vandals struck again, ransacking more sets and burning expensive costumes.\n\nBy fall, the outrage grew more serious. A fringe Hindu group, representing members of the Rajput caste \u2014 Padmavati was believed to be a Rajput \u2014 said someone should cut off the lead actress\u2019s nose.\n\nA few days later, a state-level official with the Bharatiya Janata Party, India\u2019s governing party, offered a bounty to behead the actress and director. Again, the grievance was the perception that the movie had somehow tarnished the reputation of the Rajputs\u2019 celebrated queen.\n\nThe Rajputs are a powerful voice in India, tens of millions strong, historically a warrior caste. Analysts said some politicians were exploiting the film in an attempt to unite the Rajputs into a bloc and win their votes.\n\nThe filmmakers said they tried to be sensitive to the concerns. They postponed the release date. They made a few changes to the final edit. They put a disclaimer on new movie ads, saying the film was \u201can ode to the famed valor, legacy and courage of Rajputs.\u201d\n\nThe Rajput activists were not impressed.\n\n\u201cOur stand is the same,\u201d said Lokendra Singh Kalvi, head of Shree Rajput Karni Sena, a Rajput group.

Although Alauddin Khilji, the leader of the Muslim invasion depicted in the film, and the Rajput king at the time, Ratnasimha, known as Ratan Sen in the movie, were historical figures, Padmavati, his queen, is a blank page.\n\nPerhaps revealing was Jayasi\u2019s signoff to his poem.\n\n\u201cI have made up the story and related it,\u201d are the last words of his epic.", "title": "Recipe for Ruckus in India: A Queen\u2019s Honor, a New Film and Politics", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/world/asia/padmaavat-india-rajput.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:49:40Z"}, {"textData": "(KABUL, Afghanistan) \u2014 An Afghan official says that a group of gunmen have attacked the Intercontinental Hotel in the capital Kabul.\n\nInterior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish confirmed Saturday that the hotel came under attack at around 9 p.m. local time, but could not provide additional details.\n\nAfghan Special Forces arrived at the hotel in response to attack, Danish added.\n\nNasrat Rahimi, a deputy spokesman for the Interior Ministry, confirmed that there were four attackers.

Ryan, said that Mr. Meehan was being removed immediately from the House Ethics Committee, where he has helped investigate sexual misconduct claims, and that the panel would investigate the allegations against him. In addition, Mr. Ryan told Mr. Meehan that he should repay the taxpayer funds, Ms. Strong said.\n\nSexual misconduct accusations against powerful men across a range of industries in recent months have prompted a national conversation about gender dynamics in the workplace, and the inadequacy of support systems for victims. In Congress, several lawmakers have left office or announced their retirements in recent months over sexual harassment claims.\n\nStill, Congress remains a workplace where victims say they have few effective avenues for recourse.\n\nMr. Meehan\u2019s case sheds new light on secretive congressional processes for handling such complaints, which advocates say are slanted to favor abusers, allowing them to use the vast resources of the federal government to intimidate, isolate and silence their victims.\n\nAs a member of the Ethics Committee, Mr. Meehan was tasked with being a part of the solution. The panel has initiated investigations into sexual misconduct claims against at least four congressmen in recent months. Two have resigned: Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, and John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan. The other two, Blake Farenthold, Republican of Texas, and Ruben Kihuen, a freshman Democrat from Nevada, remain in office but have said they will not seek re-election.\n\nMr. Meehan has been pushing for protections for domestic violence victims since his time as a local prosecutor. In Congress, he has sponsored legislation mandating the reporting of sexual violence, and he is a member of a bipartisan congressional task force to end such violence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis account is based on interviews with 10 people, including friends and former colleagues of the former aide and others who worked around the office. The New York Times is not naming the former aide, who followed the recommended procedures for reporting harassment but came away from the experience feeling traumatized, according to several people with whom she shared her feelings.\n\nMr. Meehan\u2019s family was close to the former aide, according to friends and colleagues, and she was regarded as an integral employee in the office, according to people who worked in or around the office. They said Mr. Meehan seemed to favor her over other employees, so much so that others saw his favoritism as unprofessional. He expressed interest in her personal relationships outside the office, then seemed to become jealous in April when word spread through the office about the aide\u2019s boyfriend. After Mr. Meehan\u2019s professions of attraction and subsequent hostility, the woman filed a complaint with the congressional Office of Compliance over the summer, alleging sexual harassment.\n\nThe handling of that complaint \u2014 which included an aggressive pushback by representatives from Mr. Meehan\u2019s office and congressional lawyers, who suggested she had misinterpreted the congressman\u2019s behavior \u2014 demoralized the aide. It led to her estrangement from her colleagues, and isolation from friends, family and her boyfriend, according to the people in whom she confided. It set her back financially and professionally, as she continued to pay legal costs associated with the complaint even after leaving her job in Mr. Meehan\u2019s office and struggling to find a new one. She moved back in with her parents and ultimately decided to start a new life abroad.\n\nMr. Meehan was represented in this process by two officials from his congressional office and two lawyers for the House\u2019s office of employment counsel.\n\nAfter counseling and mediation sessions mandated by the Office of Compliance, the sides reached an agreement that included a settlement and a strict nondisclosure agreement, according to people familiar with the process.\n\nThe exact amount of the settlement could not be determined, partly because Mr. Meehan\u2019s office paid it from a congressional office fund that allows such payments to be disguised as salary and reported months after they were made. But people familiar with the payout said it was thousands of dollars.\n\nSeveral of those interviewed traced the woman\u2019s difficulties in Mr. Meehan\u2019s office to 2016, when a senior male member of the office staff professed his romantic attraction to the woman. She reported the advance to Mr. Meehan, and the senior employee left his job after reaching an agreement with Mr. Meehan, according to a person with direct knowledge of the episode who worked in the office. Not long after, Mr. Meehan signaled his own romantic desires to the woman.\n\nThe aide\u2019s dealings with the Office of Compliance left her feeling as if the settlement was not worth the emotional distress the process had caused, said the friends and former colleagues. All spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity because they were concerned that, if lawyers for Mr. Meehan or the House accused the woman of violating the nondisclosure agreement, her settlement could be withdrawn and her career prospects further damaged.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther women who have endured the complaint process have suffered personal and professional consequences.\n\n\u201cI tried to get another job with another member of Congress, and I was blackballed. Nobody wanted to touch me,\u201d said Marion Brown, who filed the complaint that led to Mr. Conyers\u2019s resignation, and who was not speaking about the Meehan case. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still going through backlash, because he resigned without admitting doing anything wrong.\u201d\n\nUnder federal law, accusers must undergo a confidential process in which co-workers who might be able to provide corroborating evidence are excluded. They often must wait about three months before filing an official complaint, yet they must initiate the process no later than 180 days after the offending behavior. Once the process is initiated, accusers must submit to up to 30 days of counseling and complete another 30 days of mediation.\n\nMs. Ronickher, the lawyer for Mr. Meehan\u2019s accuser, declined to comment on the specifics of her case. But Ms. Ronickher, who has represented multiple congressional aides who have filed sexual harassment complaints with the Office of Compliance, said, \u201cGiven the proven dysfunction of the process as we have it now, it\u2019s critical that Congress act on legislation to revise the process so that victims aren\u2019t re-harmed when they pursue their rights.\u201d\n\nSeveral proposals are pending before Congress to overhaul the harassment reporting process, and some would bar payouts from House members\u2019 office accounts.\n\nMr. Meehan\u2019s accuser paid her own lawyers\u2019 fees, and the settlement she reached was not enough to cover her legal and living expenses while she was out of work, according to a person with whom she discussed her finances.\n\nThe congressman has been regarded as a target for Democrats because his district, which is considered among the nation\u2019s most gerrymandered, was carried narrowly by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOne of the leading Democratic prospects, State Senator Daylin Leach, suspended his bid in December, after he was accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate touching.", "title": "Patrick Meehan, Congressman Combating Harassment, Settled His Own Misconduct Case", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/us/politics/patrick-meehan-sexual-harassment.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:47:43Z"}, {"textData": "The most critical functions of government will continue and so will the non-essential bickering.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer responds to a question from the news media during a press conference as the Senate continues work on ending the government shutdown in the US Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2018. Negotiations continue in the Senate today to resolve the government shutdown. (Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA-EFE)\n\nCable networks covering the last-ditch Senate attempt to avoid a government shutdown Friday night showed scary looking clocks counting down the seconds until midnight. And then, midnight came. The government shut down. Speeches were made. OK now what?\n\nWe will see the usual grandstanding of course, the usual hyperbole. Maybe Senator Cory Booker will cry tears of rage again.\n\nBut \u201cshutdown\u201d is a misnomer because the most critical functions of government will continue. Social Security payments will be made. The Defense Department will keep defending us, though pay will be delayed. Even Robert Mueller\u2019s Russian witch hunt will keep grinding away. It\u2019s not like the United States will instantly turn into Venezuela.\n\nThe fact that this is happening over a weekend mitigates the immediate impact. Negotiations can continue and the government may be back open by Monday. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney seemed to think this would happen.\n\nMore from Robbins: Stop trying to diagnose our 'very stable genius' president. He might be right.\n\nIran unrest threatens Tehran's tyrants. Can protesters drive them out?\n\nIf not, non-excepted Federal workers will stay home. Non-excepted workers were previously known as non-essential, but that expression was done away with because it raised the obvious question, if they are non-essential why do they have jobs in the first place? It\u2019s still a good question.\n\nShutdowns are high drama but essentially low impact. The biggest outcome of the 1995-96 shutdown had nothing to do with the federal budget. When most of the paid White House staff were furloughed, the Clinton team used unpaid interns temporarily to fill in. This is how Monica Lewinski entered American history, when a pizza delivery turned into a sexual encounter.\n\nDuring the 2013 shutdown, President Obama went out of his way to amplify the effect on regular people by closing off every monument on the National Mall. He even erected barricades around the open-air, privately maintained World War Two memorial, which cost more than doing nothing. But this backfired when elderly veterans on the Mississippi Gulf Coast Honor Flight showed up, and, along with other veterans, took the barricades down. Some marched sections of fence a few blocks to the White House perimeter and stacked them up. Former Marine staff sergeant Joey Jones took down one segment even having lost both legs in Afghanistan, and his picture started trending on Twitter. It was the definition of bad optics.\n\nThis government shutdown differs from previous ones because the direct cause of the impasse has nothing to do with the budget. Democrats are attempting to use the process to force a decision on the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy that affects 800,000 immigrants. Polls show majority support for resolving DACA as a standalone issue. However, a CNN poll released Friday showed that a majority of Americans think that keeping the government open is more important than fixing DACA by 56% to 34%. The poll also showed blame for the shutdown somewhat evenly distributed between Democrats in Congress (31%), Republicans in Congress (26%) and President Trump (21%). Ten percent blame all three.\n\nLinking a non-budget issue to force a shutdown shows how dysfunctional the system has become. And since the deadline to resolve DACA is not until March, there is no pressing reason to force a crisis over it now. \u201cWe believe strongly in immigration reform,\u201d New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said. \u201cWe could say, \u2018We\u2019re shutting down the government, we\u2019re not gonna raise the debt ceiling, until you pass immigration reform.\u2019 It would be governmental chaos.\u201d But that was Schumer in 2013. In 2018, he has decided that governmental chaos is just fine, which supports the White House argument that this is the \u201cSchumer shutdown.\u201d\n\nWhoever ultimately gets blamed, the larger issue is the \u201cbudgeting by crisis\u201d that has become the norm in Washington. It has been years since the Senate has been able to budget under regular order. Instead, Senators use the reconciliation processes to duck filibusters, and continuing resolutions to kick the fiscal can down the road. And when budgets do somehow get passed, they show no evidence of a sense of fiscal responsibility and restraint. In January 2009 the public debt was $10.6 trillion. By December 2017 it had almost doubled to $20.5 Trillion. This unsustainable addiction to debt is the long-term problem, and a direct consequence of irresponsible politics. A government shutdown might help our elected officials focus on fixing the broken system before voters decide that they are non-essential and tell them to stay home.\n\nJames S.

(Khaled Desouki/pool via AP)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 On Saturday, the first day of the federal government shutdown, Vice President Pence arrived here in the late afternoon to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, whom he praised and repeatedly called a \u201cfriend\u201d of the United States.\n\nThe leaders spent roughly four hours together and delivered brief statements before a small group of reporters who are traveling with Pence \u2014 a nearly nine-minute event that only happened after intense negotiation between Pence's staff and Egyptian authorities, who wanted to limit access to one television camera with limited sound and, at one point, physically barred reporters from leaving a bus.\n\nSitting in gold-gilded chairs in front of an intricate tapestry showing a map of Egypt, Sissi said through an interpreter that Pence is a \u201cdear guest\u201d and that his visit \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about Egypt's relationship with the Trump administration. Pence said that the two countries had been \u201cdrifting apart\u201d until Trump took office but that their \u201cties have never been stronger,\u201d especially as they work together to fight terrorism in the region. He added that he chose to visit Egypt first on his four-day, three-country Middle East tour because of the importance of the U.S.-Egyptian relationship.\n\n[Pence\u2019s hopes for Middle East trip likely to crash into reality on the ground]\n\nPence denounced a terrorist attack on an Egyptian mosque in November that killed more than 300, along with recent attacks on Coptic Christians.\n\nThe public comments were warm and friendly with no mention of the disagreements between the two countries, such as President Trump's decision late last year to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and that Egypt has imprisoned several American citizens, often on questionable charges. As Pence prepared to leave on Saturday night, he told reporters that both of these issues came up in private conversations.\n\nPence arrived at the presidential palace late Saturday afternoon, along with a bus carrying the 12 reporters who are traveling with him in the Middle East this week. A CNN journalist with a video camera left the bus, but then an Egyptian official planted himself in front of the door and would not allow anyone else to leave. One of Pence's staff members firmly told the man that he needed to let everyone out, but he refused to move, forcing her to shout out the windows to others who might be able to help.\n\nAfter about three minutes, reporters were allowed off the bus but they could not take cellphones, cameras or laptops into the palace. For about 90 minutes, the reporters waited in a lavish room in the palace as the vice president's communications staff tried to convince Egyptian authorities to allow reporters to see part of the meeting. The Egyptians eventually relented when Pence learned what had happened and requested that reporters be briefly allowed inside.\n\nAfter two meetings, the two leaders and their top aides had dinner together. Pence then flew to Amman, Jordan, where he is scheduled to have a similar meeting with King Abdullah II on Sunday.\n\nBefore taking off, Pence told reporters traveling with him that he and Sissi discussed terrorism, isolating North Korea, religious freedom, the need for make changes Egypt's oversight of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and \u201cthe situation for two Americans who are currently being held, imprisoned here in Egypt.\u201d\n\nThe two Americans in question are Mostafa Kassem and Ahmed Etiwy, who the United States contends were both wrongfully imprisoned in 2013. Sissi assured him he would give their cases \u201cvery serious attention\u201d and \u201cpersonal attention,\u201d Pence said.\n\n\u201cI told him we\u2019d like to see those American citizens restored to their families and restored to our country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Jerusalem, Pence said that he heard Sissi out and reaffirmed that Trump is committed to maintaining the status quo when it comes to Holy Sites in Jerusalem and a final resolution on boundaries will be decided in the peace process. If both sides agree, the United States would support a two state solution, according to Pence. \u201cMy perception was that he was encouraged by that message,\u201d he said.\n\nPence called the overall meeting very productive.\n\n\u201cI will leave Egypt very encouraged by the conversations and even more grateful for the strong strategic partnership that the United States enjoys with Egypt,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vice president's trip is happening despite the federal government shutdown in the United States. Pence's press secretary, Alyssa Farah, said Friday that the \u201cvice president\u2019s meetings with the leaders of Egypt, Jordan and Israel are integral to America\u2019s national security and diplomatic objectives.\u201d\n\nAir Force Two was over the Atlantic Ocean when news came that Congress had not reached agreement on a spending deal and that the government would immediately shut down. Pence received the news from his chief of staff, Nick Ayers, who then briefed reporters on the plane and distributed a written statement from the vice president.\n\nAbout three hours later, the plane stopped to refuel at Ireland\u2019s Shannon Airport. Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, spent about 20 minutes in the terminal talking with dozens of young members of the Air Force who were headed to Kuwait, many for their first deployment. The couple spent most of the time posing for photos, shaking hands and thanking the troops for their service \u2014 but the shutdown also came up, as service members and other federal employees will not receive their paychecks until the shutdown ends.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get this thing figured out in Washington,\u201d Pence said after one group photo. \u201cYou guys stay focused on your mission.\u201d\n\nAs he prepared to return to Air Force Two, Pence spoke with reporters \u2014 despite urging from his wife that they needed to stay on schedule and get back on the plane \u2014 about his interactions with the troops, using it as an opportunity to attack Democrats as not doing enough to avoid a shutdown. When one reporter noted that members of the vice president\u2019s party voted against a short-term spending bill and that some Democrats voted for it, Pence said that responsibility falls primarily with Democrats in the Senate.\n\n\u201cDemocrats in the Senate \u2014 with a few exceptions on either side \u2014 chose to put politics ahead of our national defense, put politics ahead of meeting the obligations of our national government,\u201d he said, standing in an airport food court. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just unacceptable. It\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how long the shutdown might last, Pence said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take as long as it takes.\u201d He said that members of Congress need to \u201cdo their job\u201d and quickly end the impasse.", "title": "In Cairo, Pence praises the friendship and partnership between the US and Egypt - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/20/in-cairo-pence-praises-the-friendship-and-partnership-between-the-u-s-and-egypt/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:40:34Z"}, {"textData": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 An Afghan official says that a group of gunmen have attacked the Intercontinental Hotel in the capital Kabul.\n\nInterior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish confirmed Saturday that the hotel came under attack at around 9 p.m. local time, but could not provide additional details.\n\nAfghan Special Forces arrived at the hotel in response to attack, Danish added.\n\nNasrat Rahimi, a deputy spokesman for the Interior Ministry, confirmed that there were four attackers.

In Los Angeles, organizers predicted thousands of people, including state officials and celebrities, would march to City Hall.\n\nA protest in New York was among more than 200 such actions planned for the weekend around the world. By mid-morning, people gathered in Chicago, Los Angeles, Denver and Raleigh, North Carolina. In Philadelphia, many marchers wore pink cat-ear hats as a show of solidarity, while others carried signs stating opposition to Trump and his policies.\n\nIn Chicago, thousands of people gathered in Grant Park. Fawzia Mirza drew cheers from the crowd as she kicked off the event with a reference to the partial government shutdown, which began hours earlier.\n\n\u201cWhen the government shuts down, women still march,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said the event was about channeling women\u2019s energy and \u201cputting that power in the polls.\u201d\n\nEarlier Saturday, dozens of activists gathered in Rome to denounce violence against women and express support for the #MeToo movement. They were joined by Italian actress and director Asia Argento, who made headlines after alleging in 2017 she had been sexually assaulted by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in the 1990s.\n\nThe 2017 rally in Washington, D.C., and hundreds of similar marches created solidarity for those denouncing Trump\u2019s views on abortion, immigration, LGBT rights and more. Millions of people around the world marched during last year\u2019s rallies, and many on Saturday thought about all that\u2019s happened in the past year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said that I\u2019m not dispirited and discouraged over having to march yet again to register our opposition to this disastrous first year of the Trump presidency,\u201d said Peggy Taylor, a New York tour guide.\n\nShe said that last year she felt \u201ca kind of euphoria\u201d walking through the city with hundreds of thousands of participants.\n\nThis year, \u201cthe hard reality of what lies ahead of us has sunk in,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that we have a long slog ahead of us to undo the damage that this man has inflicted.\u201d\n\nThe Republican president on Friday delivered new support to the anti-abortion movement he once opposed, speaking by video to thousands of activists at the annual March for Life.\n\nIn New York, scheduled speakers included Ashley Bennett, a Democrat who was elected Atlantic County, New Jersey, freeholder last November. Bennett defeated Republican incumbent John Carman, who had mocked the 2017 women\u2019s march in Washington with a Facebook post asking whether the women would be home in time to cook dinner.\n\nAmong the goals of this year\u2019s march are getting more Democrats to run for public office and bolstering voter registration.\n\nIn Rome, Argento addressed the criticism she received once she spoke up about her abuse.\n\n\u201cWomen are scared to speak and because I was vilified by everything I said, I was called a prostitute for being raped,\u201d she said at the rally. \u201cI wonder how women who received such violence would find the courage to come out as I did, when they saw what happened to me, so I am here to assess the necessity of women to speak out and change things.\u201d\n\nArgento, who\u2019s 42, was strongly criticized by many Italian media and Italian women for not speaking out earlier and was hounded on Twitter with accusations that she sought trouble.\n\nWeinstein has apologized for causing \u201ca lot of pain\u201d with \u201cthe way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past,\u201d but he has denied \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s march in Washington sparked debate over inclusion, with some transgender minority women complaining that the event seemed designed for white women born female.

But the moment he witnessed his stern dad laugh out loud at Jonathan Winters\u2019 stick routine on \u201cThe Jack Paar Show,\u201d Williams knew he wanted to be a performer.\nNearly four years after Williams\u2019 death, HBO is set to release a new documentary on the beloved comedian\u2019s life and one-of-a-kind career. \u201cRobin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,\u201d directed by Marina Zenovich and produced by Alex Gibney and Shirel Kozak, made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival on Friday night to a sold-out crowd.\u00a0Audience members diligently followed the story of the award-winning actor from his childhood experiences at home and in school to his tragic suicide at age 63.\u00a0\nFeaturing new interviews with Williams\u2019 first wife, Valerie Velardi, \u201cMork & Mindy\u201d co-star Pam Dawber, friends David Letterman and Billy Crystal, and his son Zak Williams, the film highlights the actor\u2019s creative genius through some of his most beloved stage and screen performances, including \u201cA Night at the Met,\u201d \u201cHappy Days,\u201d Mrs. Doubtfire,\u201d \u201cAladdin,\u201d his USO tour, \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d and \u201cDead Poets Society.\u201d\u00a0\nIt also shines a light on Williams\u2019 personal life \u2015 namely, his three marriages, his addiction to drugs and alcohol, and his friendships with the likes of John Belushi, Bobcat Goldthwait and Crystal.\nThe best bit of the film involves voicemails that Williams left for Crystal, which play over a montage of photos of the close duo. Williams would try out various character impressions, like \u201cSam from the Syphilis Society,\u201d to get a rise out of his buddy. Crystal returned the favor when Williams underwent an aortic valve replacement in 2009, leaving him voicemails from \u201cVinny the Valve Guy\u201d\u00a0to help ease his recovery post-surgery.\u00a0\nCrystal reiterates that he wanted to be friends with Williams since the day he met the eccentric comedian in the 1980s. \u201cI had no agenda,\u201d Crystal says in the film, \u201cI just liked him.\u201d\u00a0\nOne of the most profound moments revolves around Belushi\u2019s overdose\u00a0\u2015 Williams was with the \u201cSNL\u201d star at his bungalow the night before he died.\u00a0On the \u201cMork & Mindy\u201d set the next day, Dawber informed Williams that Belushi had died, making a point to tell a cocaine-using Williams that she didn\u2019t want him to end up like Belushi. And he promised he never would.\n\u201cIt sobered the shit out of me,\u201d Williams admitted in a soundbite from one of the many interviews Zenovich and her team dug up for the documentary.\u00a0\nThroughout his life, Williams used humor and performance as another way to get the \u201chigh\u201d he craved in his day-to-day, according to many of the interviewees in the film. Zak Williams reveals that his father\u2019s calling \u2015 his desire to get from Hollywood what he needed \u2015 took him away from Zak and his half-siblings, Zelda and Cody.\nAlthough Williams was a standout entertainer, behind closed doors he was a mild-mannered introvert,\u00a0as both behind-the-scenes archival footage and personal videos reveal. Performer Williams was electric, while Real-Life Williams was vulnerable and quiet.\n\u201cHe was really comfortable onstage and less comfortable off,\u201d his \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d co-star Steve Martin said in the doc.\nYet for most, it was hard not to fall for Williams. Every person interviewed for \u201cCome Inside My Mind\u201d seemed eager to share heartfelt memories and stories about the actor\u2019s craft, humor and personality.\u00a0\n\u201cHe could levitate,\u201d Letterman said.\n\u201cThe urge to be funny was so innate to him,\u201d\u00a0\u201cOne Hour Photo\u201d\u00a0filmmaker Mark Romanek added.\nIn 2006, Williams fell back into alcohol use to numb some of the pain he endured. Though he did get clean and continued to treat his addiction until the end of his life in 2014, the effort did not protect him from a misdiagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease. In truth, he suffered from Lewy body dementia, which was almost surely a factor in his suicide, Goldthwait said.\nPerhaps comedian Lewis Black described Williams best in the film, stating, \u201c[He was] the light that never knew how to turn itself off.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRobin Williams: Come Inside My Mind\u201d will air on HBO this fall and is now screening at Sundance.\u00a0", "title": "'Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind' Gives Fans A Glimpse Of Comedian's Offstage Life", "sourceId": "the-huffington-post", "sourceName": "The Huffington Post", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robin-williams-come-inside-my-mind-sundance_us_5a5cd5d4e4b03c418967f2d4", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:37:15Z"}, {"textData": "The elements that produced this weekend\u2019s government shutdown sum up the first year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency: a dealmaking chief executive who can\u2019t make a deal; a divided Republican Party struggling to govern and in an uneasy relationship with the president; and a Democratic Party tethered to its anti-Trump progressive base in the face of political risk.\n\nIt was fitting that the anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration would be a day of chaos, uncertainty, recrimination and efforts at political point-scoring. That has been a hallmark of the Trump presidency. Why should the anniversary of his swearing-in be significantly different from most of the previous 365 days?\n\nA year ago, in his inaugural address, Trump promised to bring a swift end to what he called \u201cthis American carnage.\u201d He promised disruption. At the one-year mark, the Trump era has certainly brought disruption to the capital, exposing the fault lines and vulnerabilities of the governing process. The shutdown could be short in duration \u2014 it is good for neither party, nor the president \u2014 but the climate of distrust and ill will is not going away.\n\nIn the early hours of Saturday, after the last efforts to avoid a shutdown failed and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) traded accusations of blame, some scorekeepers were trying to assess the political fallout. That probably will prove a fruitless exercise.\n\nPolls offered contradictory predictions. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that 48 percent of Americans said they would blame Trump and the Republicans for the shutdown rather than Democrats, whom only 28 percent blame. A CNN poll found that by 56 to 34 percent, people said avoiding a shutdown was more important than dealing with the fate of the undocumented immigrants known as \u201cdreamers\u201d at this time.\n\nA short-term spending bill failed during a procedural vote in the Senate late on Jan. 19, taking the government closer to a shutdown. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Jordan Frasier/The Washington Post)\n\nHistory suggests caution, however, in predicting the impact. In 2011, President Barack Obama thought he could avoid the fallout when the debt ceiling negotiations with congressional Republicans imploded. He was wrong; although a shutdown was averted, everybody in Washington took a hit. Two years later, many people predicted political doom for Republicans after House hard-liners led the government into a shutdown. A year later, the GOP went on to win a handsome victory in the 2014 midterms.\n\nSo it is better to stay in the moment. Begin with the president. If he had one attribute that seemed credible as he campaigned in 2016, it was that he liked to make deals. He is a transactional being by nature, given not to political philosophy or introspection or policy smarts or deep analysis. He likes action that produces trophies.\n\nYet the story the past two weeks is of a president who either doesn\u2019t know his own mind, isn\u2019t in charge of his own White House or simply cannot be trusted with his word. He ping-ponged from promising to take heat if legislators brought him an immigration deal, to balking when Sens. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) delivered the outlines of one, to unexpectedly summoning Schumer to the White House on Friday for talks, to deciding or being persuaded by those around him not to go ahead with whatever he and Schumer were discussing.\n\n[Everything you need to know about the shutdown]\n\nThat\u2019s the record as it appears from outside the room. The full story of what really transpired inside over those many days is still being reported and written, and there\u2019s little doubt that revisionism is taking place at a furious pace. History is written by the winners, but in this case, there are no winners. No one can claim victory when the governing process collapses as it did Friday.\n\nBut the president bears significant responsibility for the mixed signals he delivered and for not making clear his bottom line. It was telling that neither the Democrats nor Trump\u2019s Republican allies on Capitol Hill knew what he was willing to accept.\n\nThe Republicans own the government in Washington, controlling the White House, the House and the Senate. Yet over the past year, they have found themselves repeatedly stymied by their own internal divisions, their lack of clarity on matters such as health care, and their tense relationship with a president whom few of them favored during the 2016 GOP primaries and whose behavior rankles even those who have remained relatively silent.\n\nThe Ohio Clock outside the Senate Chamber strikes midnight at the Capitol, signaling the beginning of the government shutdown. (Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe Republicans have made a bargain: accept the president\u2019s bad behavior as a price for moving a conservative agenda. They\u2019ve pushed through judges at a fast pace. They managed to pass a tax bill in record speed at the end of last year, an accomplishment they hope will pay dividends in an election year they head into with a certain amount of dread. But this has been anything but an enjoyable year for those who dreamed for years of having the kind of power the party now has.\n\nSince the fall \u2014 as Republicans pushed to lower the corporate tax rate and provide income tax cuts that will greatly benefit the wealthy \u2014 two vulnerable populations awaited help.\n\nOne group is the dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, who were given protected status by Obama but suddenly saw that protection taken away by Trump.\n\nThe other is the beneficiaries of one of the most popular and successful safety net programs of the modern era, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, better known as CHIP.\n\nBoth these groups of young people became central players in what turned into monthly battles over funding the government for the duration of this fiscal year. That, despite the fact that an overwhelming percentage of Americans \u2014 including elected officials from both parties, as well as the president \u2014 favor extending CHIP and restoring the dreamers\u2019 protection from deportation.\n\nBorder security is one price Trump and conservatives demand for a deal to protect the dreamers \u2014 that and other changes to the immigration system. Congressional Republicans nervously watched as Schumer went into a meeting with the president with none of their party\u2019s leaders in the room, their fears eased somewhat by their confidence that White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly would prevent the president from making a deal conservative hard-liners would reject.\n\n[GOP embraces Trump\u2019s hard line on immigration]\n\nRepublicans attached a six-year extension of CHIP to the latest short-term spending bill, hoping the move would force Democrats to swallow the bill without a deal on the dreamers. That calculation, cynical in the eyes of Democrats \u2014 who have been calling for action on CHIP for months \u2014 failed and created the conditions that helped bring about the shutdown.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, showed how a year of grass-roots resistance to Trump has affected their party. The party not only leans further to the left; it is also more militant in opposition to the president, making any negotiation complicated. The power of this resistance blossomed the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration with the Women\u2019s March, nationwide outpourings that were larger and stronger than anyone anticipated. Women continue to lead the resistance to Trump, and Saturday\u2019s anniversary marches across the country highlighted that anew.\n\nMeanwhile, on Capitol Hill, daily demonstrations by dreamers and their allies have heightened the pressure on Schumer and other Democratic leaders not to let another opportunity pass to fix their status. They urged party elected officials to stand firm, using this short-term spending bill as leverage, although the ultimate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deadline is in early March.\n\nThe demands of the base not to yield on immigration, however, do put red-state Senate Democrats, who face tough reelection challenges, in an untenable position. Four of them \u2014 Indiana\u2019s Joe Donnelly, Missouri\u2019s Claire McCaskill, North Dakota\u2019s Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin III \u2014 defected on the key vote and sided with Republicans. They were joined by the chamber\u2019s newest senator, Democrat Doug Jones of Alabama.\n\nThe split between the vulnerable red-state senators and the rest of the party underscored the ideological center of gravity in the Democratic Party and the commitment to base-driven politics that party strategists see as their best path ahead.\n\nThe principal actors will find a way out of this shutdown, although any agreement could again be temporary. That will put it back on Trump\u2019s shoulders to decide what kind of deal he\u2019s prepared to make \u2014 and on Democratic leaders to choose how much to yield on border security and other presidential demands. But nothing is likely to change the underlying dynamics that created this moment.

I don\u2019t need to correct my vision for presbyopia yet, but I can tell it\u2019s coming. I can still read the The New York Times print edition with ease, but to read text in somewhat smaller fonts, I have to strain. Any year now, I figured my eye doctor would tell me it was time to talk about bifocals.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nThen I undertook a monthslong, strenuous regimen designed to train my brain to correct for what my eye muscles no longer can manage.\n\nThe approach has been reported in the news media, and perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it. It\u2019s based on perceptual learning, the improvement of visual performance as a result of demanding training on specific images. Some experts have expressed skepticism that it can work, but a number of studies provide evidence that it can improve visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and reading speed.\n\nThe training involves looking at images called \u201cGabor patches\u201d in various conditions. Gabor patches optimally stimulate the part of the brain responsible for vision. A great deal of the training involves trying to see Gabor patches placed between closely spaced, distracting flankers. In training, the flanker spacing is varied, the target contrast is turned way down, and the images are flashed on a screen for fractions of a second \u2014 to the point that one can barely see the target.\n\nPhoto\n\nDo this and similar exercises hundreds of times over multiple sessions weekly; continue for months; and, gradually, presbyopia lessens, a number of studies show.\n\nOne study also examined functions of the eye itself and found none of these improvements were because of changes in the eye. They\u2019re all in the brain.\n\nVarious smartphone apps say they offer this kind of vision-improving training; I used one called GlassesOff, the only one I found that was backed by scientific studies.\n\nPerceptual learning can improve the vision of people who already see quite well and those with other conditions. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called \u201clazy eye,\u201d which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population. It may also improve vision in those with mild myopia (nearsightedness).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible. One study published in Psychological Science trained 16 college-aged adults and 16 older adults (around age 71) with Gabor patch exercises for 1.5 hours per day for seven days. After training, the older adults\u2019 ability to see low-contrast images improved to the level that the college-age ones had before training.\n\nScientists don\u2019t know exactly how perceptual learning relieves presbyopia, but they have some clues based on how our brain processes visual information.\n\nAfter first taking in \u201craw data\u201d of an image through the eye, different sets of neurons in the brain process it as separate features like edges and colors. Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about 250 milliseconds to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word. Once they do so, we\u2019re taking in more information from whatever the eyes focus on next. If we haven\u2019t yet processed the prior set of information, we can\u2019t understand it.\n\nVisual processing time is challenged and slowed by noisy images, low contrast or closely spaced information (like small fonts). There is a bottleneck in the brain as it attempts to build and then comprehend the image. Therefore, enhancing and speeding up the ability to process image components \u2014 through perceptual learning \u2014 improves a wide range of vision functions.\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising is that this is possible in adult brains. Neuroplasticity \u2014 the ability of the brain\u2019s processing functions to change to acquire new skills \u2014 is most strongly associated with childhood. It\u2019s still more pronounced in children than adults, but for some skills, including vision, the brain is more malleable than once thought.\n\nThe training with GlassesOff is long and challenging. I found it fun initially, perhaps because it was new. But weeks into it, I began to dread the monotonous labor. Yet, after a couple of months, the app reports I can read fonts nearly one third the size I could when I started and much more rapidly. According to feedback from GlassesOff, my vision after training is equivalent to a man about 10 years younger than my age. If I reach 50 \u2014 the age at which almost everyone needs corrective lenses to read \u2014 and still don\u2019t need reading glasses, I may conclude that the training has paid off.\n\nAs apps go, GlassesOff is not cheap. I paid $24.99 for three months of use \u2014 long enough to get me through the initial program. Upon completion, I was invited to pay another $59.99 per year for maintenance training. It\u2019s a nice option, but the hard work and price probably mean that the bifocals market will remain strong.", "title": "Training Your Brain So That You Don\u2019t Need Reading Glasses (2017)", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:23:07Z"}, {"textData": "Afghan security officials take positions near the scene of the attack at Kabul\u2019s Intercontinental Hotel on Saturday.

Here\u2019s what those polls show about how Americans view him so far, and what might happen in 2018.\n1. Trump\u2019s approval rating started off historically bad. It\u2019s only gotten worse.\nTrump marks his first anniversary as president more unpopular than he was when he took the job. That\u2019s not unusual \u2015 many first-term presidents see their numbers drop.\nWhat\u2019s unusual about Trump is just how little goodwill he began with. Unlike his recent predecessors, he took office with Americans equally split between approving and disapproving of his job performance, according to HuffPost Pollster\u2019s average of public polling \u2015 and that marked a relative high point. \nWithin a month, Trump saw his disapproval ratings begin to rise as those who\u2019d previously been neutral became increasingly less likely to give him the benefit of the doubt. \nTrump\u2019s first months were marked by \u201cno honeymoon period to speak of and approval ratings far worse than any president has received this early in his tenure\u201d Gallup\u2019s Jeffrey M. Jones wrote in April, after Trump posted the worst first-quarter ratings for any president elected to his first term since World War II. \nA year later, surveys are consistent in showing that a majority of the nation is unhappy with the president\u2019s performance. About 55 percent disapprove of the job he\u2019s done, per Pollster\u2019s average as of Saturday morning, while just under 41 percent approve.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s an improvement from December, but these are still\u00a0easily the worst numbers for a first-year president since pollsters first began keeping track. Trump\u2019s standing is\u00a0similar to President Richard Nixon\u2019s\u00a0months into the Senate hearings on the Watergate scandal. And, according to data collected by Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School poll, while individual pollsters\u2019 assessments of Trump vary, nearly all find him lagging behind his immediate predecessor, former President Barack Obama.\n\u00a02. Trump\u2019s numbers are relatively stable.\nIn the last six months, Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained between 37 and 42 percent in Pollster\u2019s average, neither soaring nor dramatically crashing. \u00a0\n\u201cTrump\u2019s approval ratings aren\u2019t just noteworthy because they are low,\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Struyk noted Wednesday in an analysis of Gallup data. \u201cThey are also the flattest, least fluid approval ratings for any elected president since modern surveys started.\u201d\n\u201cDuring his first year, Trump\u2019s approval ratings have stayed within a narrow 10-point range \u2015 from 45% at his inauguration to a low of 35% multiple times over the last several months,\u201d Struyk said. \u201cFormer President Barack Obama\u2019s had moved 18 points, George W. Bush\u2019s had moved 39 points and Bill Clinton\u2019s had moved 22 points to this point in their tenures. In fact, only Lyndon B. Johnson had less movement in approval polling during his first year in office.\u201d\nThat could indicate that Trump may be close to his natural floor of support for the current political situation (the not-inconceivable development of something like a foreign policy crisis or an economic slump would, of course, change the calculus.) \nBut it may also mean there\u2019s little room for him to rebound to a neutral or positive rating. Most Americans who disapprove of Trump say that they don\u2019t see anything positive about his record, and that there\u2019s almost nothing he can do to change their minds.\u00a0\nAnd although it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact causes of the smaller approval fluctuations for Trump in 2017, there are some clues. Trump saw distinct dips in support following Republican failures to pass a health care repeal bill, while months of stories about his campaign\u2019s relationship to Russia seemingly did less to move the needle \u2015 possibly in part because his supporters were more troubled by the former than the latter. \nBy contrast, his numbers ticked up during last fall\u2019s hurricane season, perhaps both because he saw some of his best ratings as president for his handling of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and because the weather-focused news cycle kept his name out of the headlines more than usual. \n3. Opinions of Trump are deeply polarized, but he inspires more robust opposition than support.\nSurvey after survey conducted last year showed Americans to be immensely polarized on practically every political issue, with the clearest example being opinions of Trump himself. Opinions on many of the actions Trump has taken \u2015 for instance, concerns about his administration\u2019s relationship with Russia \u2015 remain more or less intractably divided along party lines. That polarization is another factor in the stability of Trump\u2019s ratings.\nAmericans\u2019 willingness to support a president across the aisle has shrunk dramatically in recent years. That trend accelerated markedly under Trump, who has reasonably strong ratings within his own party but remarkably little backing from the opposition. \nLast spring, we noted that Republicans were 78 points likelier than Democrats to approve of Trump\u2019s first-quarter job performance. Between Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton, that gap was never above 50 points.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s entirely true that most of the president\u2019s voters are sticking with him, it\u2019s also true that \u201cmost\u201d is not the same as \u201call.\u201d And notably, Trump\u2019s detractors are far more unified \u2015 and vociferous \u2015 than his supporters. \nNearly 60 percent of Trump voters strongly approve of his job performance, according to YouGov/Economist tracking data \u2015 but nearly 90 percent of Clinton voters strongly disapprove. \u00a0\nSimilarly, strong disapproval of the GOP\u2019s failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its successful bid to pass tax reform has consistently outstripped the strong approval of such efforts.\n4. Views of the economy are way out of whack with views of the presidency.\nThroughout 2017, pollsters found Americans generally happy with the state of the economy, but less happy with Trump.\n\u201cIf you take the president\u2019s scores out of this poll, you see a nation increasingly happy about the economy,\u201d pollster J. Ann Selzer told Bloomberg in July. \u201cWhen Trump\u2019s name is mentioned, the clouds gather.\u201d\nThat\u2019s unusual: Economic views are traditionally among the strongest drivers of presidential approval. As FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten noted last fall, past presidents dating back to Jimmy Carter had higher ratings on overall job approval than they did for their handling of the economy. Trump breaks that pattern in a major way. \nIt\u2019s perhaps understandable that the public wouldn\u2019t give Trump much credit for an economic revival that clearly predated his presidency. Nearly a year into Trump\u2019s term, voters are still more likely to say that Obama is responsible for the state of the economy. \nBut Trump\u2019s approval rating, Gallup found, is 9 to 14 points lower than the public\u2019s views of the economy would predict.\n5. Trump\u2019s low approval rating probably matters for this year\u2019s elections.\nIt\u2019s still a little too soon to be talking about Trump\u2019s re-election prospects, but his unpopularity poses a more immediate problem for the GOP: The president\u2019s party tends to do worse in midterms when the president\u2019s ratings are low. \n\u201cHistorically, when voters are unhappy with a president, they take it out on his party during the midterm elections,\u201d The Weekly Standard\u2019s David Byler wrote this week. \u201cTrump\u2019s approval rating and the Republican share of the generic congressional vote typically aren\u2019t far off each other. This suggests that voters who disapprove of Trump are unwilling or at least hesitant to support the congressional GOP.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd while good economic indicators would normally be a boon to the GOP, Trump\u2019s unpopularity, and his tendency to dominate the news cycle, may overshadow them. This year\u2019s midterms are still months away, and there\u2019s plenty of time for things to change \u2015 several recent surveys have shown the Democratic lead in congressional polling starting to taper. \nBut as things stand, Trump\u2019s position at the head of the party seems unlikely to do down-ballot Republican candidates many favors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get any traction on anything, so far, other than the president personally,\u201d Republican pollster Bill McInturff told NBC.\nA few more roundups of the polling on Trump\u2019s first year:\n\n\nPew Research: \u201cAs Donald Trump\u2019s presidency approaches the one-year mark, 41% say Trump will be an unsuccessful president in the long run, while 23% say he will be successful and 34% say that it is too early to tell.\u201d\n\n\nCBS\u2019s Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto: \u201cA year after President Donald Trump was sworn into office, he continues to receive historically low and highly partisan approval ratings, despite widely positive views of the economy. He gets at least some credit for the economy, but most Americans don\u2019t feel they\u2019ve personally benefitted from his policies \u2013 only 22 percent think they\u2019ve been directly helped.\u201d\n\n\nYouGov\u2019s Kathy Frankovic: \u201cThe President ends his first year in office with an approval rating higher than he has seen in months. While a majority of the public continues to disapprove, 42% in the latest Economist/YouGov Poll approve of the President\u2019s performance, a level not seen in these poll since February 2017.\u201d\n\n\nGallup\u2019s Justin McCarthy: \u201cAmericans are split in their views on how President Donald Trump\u2019s performance in office compares with their expectations for him. About one in five (21%) say he has done better than they expected, while more, 35%, say he\u2019s done worse. The largest segment, 44%, says his performance has been about what they expected.\u201d\n\n\nNBC\u2019s Mark Murray: \u201cPresident Donald Trump ends his first year in office with 39 percent of Americans approving of his job performance, according to the latest national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll \u2014 the lowest mark in the poll\u2019s history for any modern president ending his first year.\u201d\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Times\u2019 David Lauter: \u201cAs the anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration approaches on Saturday, the president\u2019s support has eroded, his opposition has gained energy and his party faces bleak prospects for the midterm elections in November, according to a new USC-Dornsife/Los Angeles Times nationwide poll.\u201d\n\n\nNPR\u2019s Jessica Taylor: \u201cAs President Trump approaches the one-year anniversary of his inauguration, a majority of Americans think that his first year in office has been a failure and that he has divided the nation.\u201d\n\n", "title": "5 Things The Polls Show About Trump\u2019s First Year", "sourceId": "the-huffington-post", "sourceName": "The Huffington Post", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trumps-first-year-polls_us_5a636231e4b0dc592a092bab", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T17:48:21Z"}, {"textData": "We\u2019re now a full year \u2015 and more than 500 approval polls\u00a0\u2015 into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Here\u2019s what those polls show about how Americans view him so far, and what might happen in 2018.\n1. Trump\u2019s approval rating started off historically bad. It\u2019s only gotten worse.\nTrump marks his first anniversary as president more unpopular than he was when he took the job. That\u2019s not unusual \u2015 many first-term presidents see their numbers drop.\nWhat\u2019s unusual about Trump is just how little goodwill he began with. Unlike his recent predecessors, he took office with Americans equally split between approving and disapproving of his job performance, according to HuffPost Pollster\u2019s average of public polling \u2015 and that marked a relative high point. \nWithin a month, Trump saw his disapproval ratings begin to rise as those who\u2019d previously been neutral became increasingly less likely to give him the benefit of the doubt. \nTrump\u2019s first months were marked by \u201cno honeymoon period to speak of and approval ratings far worse than any president has received this early in his tenure\u201d Gallup\u2019s Jeffrey M. Jones wrote in April, after Trump posted the worst first-quarter ratings for any president elected to his first term since World War II. \nA year later, surveys are consistent in showing that a majority of the nation is unhappy with the president\u2019s performance. About 55 percent disapprove of the job he\u2019s done, per Pollster\u2019s average as of Saturday morning, while just under 41 percent approve.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s an improvement from December, but these are still\u00a0easily the worst numbers for a first-year president since pollsters first began keeping track. Trump\u2019s standing is\u00a0similar to President Richard Nixon\u2019s\u00a0months into the Senate hearings on the Watergate scandal. And, according to data collected by Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School poll, while individual pollsters\u2019 assessments of Trump vary, nearly all find him lagging behind his immediate predecessor, former President Barack Obama.\n\u00a02. Trump\u2019s numbers are relatively stable.\nIn the last six months, Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained between 37 and 42 percent in Pollster\u2019s average, neither soaring nor dramatically crashing. \u00a0\n\u201cTrump\u2019s approval ratings aren\u2019t just noteworthy because they are low,\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Struyk noted Wednesday in an analysis of Gallup data. \u201cThey are also the flattest, least fluid approval ratings for any elected president since modern surveys started.\u201d\n\u201cDuring his first year, Trump\u2019s approval ratings have stayed within a narrow 10-point range \u2015 from 45% at his inauguration to a low of 35% multiple times over the last several months,\u201d Struyk said. \u201cFormer President Barack Obama\u2019s had moved 18 points, George W. Bush\u2019s had moved 39 points and Bill Clinton\u2019s had moved 22 points to this point in their tenures. In fact, only Lyndon B. Johnson had less movement in approval polling during his first year in office.\u201d\nThat could indicate that Trump may be close to his natural floor of support for the current political situation (the not-inconceivable development of something like a foreign policy crisis or an economic slump would, of course, change the calculus.) \nBut it may also mean there\u2019s little room for him to rebound to a neutral or positive rating. Most Americans who disapprove of Trump say that they don\u2019t see anything positive about his record, and that there\u2019s almost nothing he can do to change their minds.\u00a0\nAnd although it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact causes of the smaller approval fluctuations for Trump in 2017, there are some clues. Trump saw distinct dips in support following Republican failures to pass a health care repeal bill, while months of stories about his campaign\u2019s relationship to Russia seemingly did less to move the needle \u2015 possibly in part because his supporters were more troubled by the former than the latter. \nBy contrast, his numbers ticked up during last fall\u2019s hurricane season, perhaps both because he saw some of his best ratings as president for his handling of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and because the weather-focused news cycle kept his name out of the headlines more than usual. \n3. Opinions of Trump are deeply polarized, but he inspires more robust opposition than support.\nSurvey after survey conducted last year showed Americans to be immensely polarized on practically every political issue, with the clearest example being opinions of Trump himself. Opinions on many of the actions Trump has taken \u2015 for instance, concerns about his administration\u2019s relationship with Russia \u2015 remain more or less intractably divided along party lines. That polarization is another factor in the stability of Trump\u2019s ratings.\nAmericans\u2019 willingness to support a president across the aisle has shrunk dramatically in recent years. That trend accelerated markedly under Trump, who has reasonably strong ratings within his own party but remarkably little backing from the opposition. \nLast spring, we noted that Republicans were 78 points likelier than Democrats to approve of Trump\u2019s first-quarter job performance. Between Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton, that gap was never above 50 points.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s entirely true that most of the president\u2019s voters are sticking with him, it\u2019s also true that \u201cmost\u201d is not the same as \u201call.\u201d And notably, Trump\u2019s detractors are far more unified \u2015 and vociferous \u2015 than his supporters. \nNearly 60 percent of Trump voters strongly approve of his job performance, according to YouGov/Economist tracking data \u2015 but nearly 90 percent of Clinton voters strongly disapprove. \u00a0\nSimilarly, strong disapproval of the GOP\u2019s failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its successful bid to pass tax reform has consistently outstripped the strong approval of such efforts.\n4. Views of the economy are way out of whack with views of the presidency.\nThroughout 2017, pollsters found Americans generally happy with the state of the economy, but less happy with Trump.\n\u201cIf you take the president\u2019s scores out of this poll, you see a nation increasingly happy about the economy,\u201d pollster J.

In a late-night vote, Senate Democrats blocked a bill that would have kept the government running for four weeks. (Jan. 20) AP\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., walks to the chamber on the first morning of a government shutdown Saturday, Jan. 20, 2018. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional leaders and White House officials scurried around the Capitol during a rare Saturday session but offered no clear path to resolving the bitter spending-and-immigration impasse that led to a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday.\n\nThe mood seemed calm and quiet, as Democrats and Republicans huddled in separate closed-door meetings \u2014 emerging only to point fingers at the other party for a stalemate that has shuttered federal agencies and jeopardized government services across the country. On the House and Senate floors, no meaningful legislative business occurred, though lawmakers stayed in town and on call.\n\n\"We're on standby, hour by hour,\" said Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would force another vote on a short-term funding bill at 1 a.m. Monday, unless there's an agreement before then. That will ramp up the pressure on both sides to come up with a deal over the next 24 hours.\n\nThe federal government has been operating on short-term spending bills since Oct.1, when the prior fiscal year ended without Congress approving federal spending for this year.\n\nThe shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, after the Senate blocked a short-term spending bill \u2014 called a \"continuing resolution\" \u2014 Friday night as the prior short-term spending measure expired. Government agencies began ramping down operations Saturday, the one-year anniversary of President Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nIn the Senate, there was one offer on the table that could lead to a breakthrough \u2014 a three-week spending bill with a promise to use that time to hash out an immigration deal and other contentious issues \u2014 but its prospects seemed to dim as the day unfolded.\n\nMcConnell signaled he was open to that proposal to fund the government through Feb. 8, and a key player in bipartisan immigration negotiations, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he thinks it could work.\n\n\u201cAfter extensive discussions with senators on both sides of the aisle, I believe such a proposal would pass,\u201d Graham said in a statement Saturday morning. He said it would come with a requirement that if lawmakers don\u2019t reach an agreement on immigration before the Feb. 8 deadline, McConnell would allow a free-flowing debate on the Senate floor to resolve the fate of the \u201cDREAMers,\u201d young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\n\nThose immigrants now have legal protections under an Obama-era program known as DACA. But Trump announced in September he would kill the DACA program and nix the legal protections for more than 700,000 DACA recipients as of March 5.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident we can find a solution to Border Security/DACA once we start the process,\u201d Graham said. \u201cSuccess on this will lead to a breakthrough on all other issues.\u201d\n\nMore: Why airlines keep flying during government shutdown\n\nMore: Trump's one-year anniversary marked by shutdown instead of celebration\n\nMore: Government shutdown 2018: What we know now, what happens next\n\nBut White House officials and House Republicans said they would not engage in any discussions about immigration until Democrats agreed to re-open the government.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s position is that as soon as they reopen the government, we\u2019ll resume conversations on DACA,\u201d Marc Short, Trump\u2019s congressional liaison, told reporters after meeting with House Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to negotiate on that when (Democrats are) keeping our border agents not paid, keeping our troops unpaid, not paying for American services.\u201d\n\nImmigration is a hot-button issue that animates conservatives and liberals alike, making it hard for either side to budge for fear of angering their base ahead of the 2018 elections.\n\nDemocrats are under intense pressure from liberal voters and Latinos to help the DREAMers \u2014 and to push back against a president they see as racist and divisive. Republicans face similar heat from hard-line conservatives who equate any legal protections for undocumented immigrants as \"amnesty.\"\n\nTrump revved up simmering animosity toward immigrants during his 2016 campaign, but he has given conflicting signals since taking office. He said last week that he wanted a \"bill of love\" to help the DREAMers, but then rejected a bipartisan deal proposed by Graham, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and four other senators.\n\nThe politics for the GOP are perhaps even more perilous. Some moderate Republicans say DACA has to be part of any broader budget agreement, and the Graham-Durbin bill appears to have significant support in the Senate. But Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., would face a withering backlash from conservatives if he agreed to put that proposal, or anything similar, on the House floor as part of a broader spending deal.\n\n\"He's not going to do that,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-S.C., chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. \"I\u2019m 100% sure at this point we\u2019re only going to focus on opening the government back up.\"\n\nRep. Charlie Dent, R-Penn., said there was no other way to resolve the impasse except to link the two.\n\n\"We\u2019re not going to get off this treadmill of (short-term spending bills) until we get serious negotiating on the budget agreement ... and DACA,\" Dent said. \"It\u2019s that simple.\"\n\nAsked if GOP leaders would face blowback, Dent said: \"They might, but that's the price of leadership.\"\n\nLawmakers continued to look for ways to resolve the stalemate Saturday, even as each side appeared to dig in for another day of political warfare.\n\nShort said Trump spoke with McConnell Saturday morning and would be in contact with other congressional leaders throughout the day. But he said the president did not have any meetings scheduled to mediate the standoff.\n\nIn the meantime, the partisanship played out in dueling press conferences. House and Senate Democrats tried to pin blame on Trump and GOP leaders for failing to come up with a broad budget deal.\n\n\u201cWe are at this point for one reason and one reason only, and that\u2019s the incompetence of the leadership of the Republican majority in the House and Senate and the incompetence of the leadership in the White House,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., warned that Democrats will not support another short-term spending bill unless there is an outline of a broader agreement on other major issues, including long-term funding increases for defense and domestic programs.\n\n\u201cIt's no use having another CR unless we have the terms of engagement on how we go forward\u201d on immigration, border security and other issues, she said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the paralysis is a \u201cmercurial\u201d president and weak Republican leaders.\n\n\u201cNegotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor Saturday. \u201cRepublican leaders refuse to move ahead without President Trump, and President Trump is so mercurial it\u2019s been impossible to get him to agree to anything.\u201d\n\nTrump and Republicans labeled the impasse the \"Schumer shutdown,\" saying the blame fell squarely on Senate Democrats who blocked passage of the spending measure during Friday's vote.

O\u2019Malley, Pope Francis\u2019 top adviser on clerical sex abuse, implicitly rebuked the pontiff over his accusations of slander against Chilean abuse victims, saying Saturday, Jan. 20, 2018, that his words were \u201ca source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse.\u201d (Isabella Bonotto, File/Associated Press)\n\nLIMA, Peru \u2014 Pope Francis\u2019 top adviser on clerical sex abuse implicitly rebuked the pontiff for having accused Chilean victims of slander, saying Saturday that his words were \u201ca source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nCardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, said he couldn\u2019t explain why Francis \u201cchose the particular words he used.\u201d He said such expressions had the effect of abandoning victims and relegating them to \u201cdiscredited exile.\u201d\n\nIn an extraordinary effort at damage control, O\u2019Malley insisted in a statement that Francis \u201cfully recognizes the egregious failures of the church and its clergy who abused children and the devastating impact those crimes have had on survivors and their loved ones.\u201d\n\nFrancis set off a national uproar upon leaving Chile on Thursday when he accused victims of the country\u2019s most notorious pedophile priest of having slandered another bishop, Juan Barros. The victims say Barros knew of the abuse by the Rev. Fernando Karadima but did nothing to stop it \u2014 a charge Barros denies.\n\n\u201cThe day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I\u2019ll speak,\u201d Francis told Chilean journalists in the northern city of Iquique. \u201cThere is not one shred of proof against him. It\u2019s all calumny. Is that clear?\u201d\n\nThe remarks shocked Chileans, drew immediate outrage from victims and their advocates and once again raised the question of whether the 81-year-old Argentine Jesuit \u201cgets it\u201d about sex abuse.\n\nThe Karadima scandal has devastated the credibility of the Roman Catholic Church in Chile, and Francis\u2019 comments will likely haunt it for the foreseeable future.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s carefully worded critique was remarkable since it is rare for a cardinal to publicly rebuke the pope in such terms. But Francis\u2019 remarks were so potentially toxic to the Vatican\u2019s yearslong effort to turn the tide on decades of clerical sex abuse and cover-up that he clearly felt he had to respond.\n\nO\u2019Malley headed Francis\u2019 much-touted committee for the protection of minors until it lapsed last month after its initial three-year mandate expired. Francis has not named new members, and the committee\u2019s future remains unclear.\n\nO\u2019Malley, who took over as Boston archbishop from the disgraced Cardinal Bernard Law after the sex abuse scandal exploded there in 2002, was traveling to Peru on Saturday to meet with the pope. His spokesman said the trip was previously scheduled. Francis leaves Sunday to return to Rome.\n\n\u201cIt is understandable that Pope Francis\u2019 statements ... were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in the statement. \u201cWords that convey the message \u2018if you cannot prove your claims then you will not be believed\u2019 abandon those who have suffered reprehensible criminal violations of their human dignity and relegate survivors to discredited exile.\u201d\n\nFrancis\u2019 comments were all the more problematic because Karadima\u2019s victims were deemed so credible by the Vatican that it sentenced him to a lifetime of \u201cpenance and prayer\u201d in 2011 based on their testimony. A Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible, saying that while she had to drop charges against Karadima because too much time had passed, proof of his crimes wasn\u2019t lacking.\n\nThose same victims accused Barros of witnessing the abuse. Yet Francis said he considered their accusations \u201call calumny\u201d and that he wouldn\u2019t believe them without proof.\n\nCatholic officials for years sought to discredit victims by accusing them of slandering and attacking the church with their claims. But many in the church and the Vatican had come to acknowledge that victims usually told the truth and that the church had wrongly sought to protect its own by demonizing and discrediting the most vulnerable of its flock.\n\nO\u2019Malley said he couldn\u2019t fully address the Barros case because he didn\u2019t know the details and wasn\u2019t involved. But he insisted the pope \u201cgets it\u201d and is committed to \u201czero tolerance\u201d for abuse.\n\n\u201cAccompanying the Holy Father at numerous meetings with survivors I have witnessed his pain of knowing the depth and breadth of the wounds inflicted on those who were abused and that the process of recovery can take a lifetime,\u201d he said.\n\nKaradima\u2019s victims reported to church authorities as early as 2002 that he would kiss and fondle them in the swank Santiago parish he ran. But only when they went public with their accusations in 2010 did the Vatican launch an investigation that led to his removal from ministry.\n\nThe emeritus archbishop of Santiago subsequently apologized for having refused to believe the victims from the start.\n\nFrancis reopened the wounds of the scandal in 2015 when he named Barros, a protege of Karadima, as bishop of the southern diocese of Osorno.\n\nHis appointment outraged Chileans, badly divided the Osorno diocese and further undermined the church\u2019s credibility in the country.\n\nAs recently as 2014, the Vatican was prepared to ask Barros and two other Karadima-trained bishops to resign and take a year sabbatical, according to a January 2015 letter from Francis to Chilean bishops that was obtained by The Associated Press. The plan fell apart, however, and Francis named Barros to head the Osorno diocese.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ms. Rousseff decried her removal from office in August 2016 as a \u201ccoup,\u201d masterminded by center-right politicians who had failed to attain power through the ballot box.\n\nThe political whiplash of the past few years has made Brazilians more discontented with democracy than any other Latin American population, according to a 2017 poll conducted by Latinobar\u00f3metro. The survey found that only 13 percent of Brazilians were satisfied with democracy, and that 97 percent felt their government catered to a small, powerful elite.\n\n\u201cBrazilian society is in a critical state,\u201d said Marta Lagos, the head of Latinobar\u00f3metro. \u201cPeople feel abandoned by institutions.\u201d\n\nAs a three-judge panel in the southern city of Porto Alegre weighs Mr. da Silva\u2019s appeal, the former president has argued that disqualifying him as a candidate would be a further blow to democracy.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that it is the Brazilian people who are being sentenced,\u201d Mr. da Silva told a small group of journalists in S\u00e3o Paulo on Thursday. \u201cThe Brazilian people have seen their country lose respect abroad, they are watching unemployment grow, they\u2019re watching as people lose all the labor rights that were won over the past 60 years.\u201d\n\nWorkers\u2019 Party officials say Mr. da Silva will appeal for the right to appear on the ballot even if the court upholds his conviction, which by law would technically make him ineligible to run for office. If that fails, it is unclear who would replace him. The Workers\u2019 Party has no other figure with Mr. da Silva\u2019s name recognition and appeal.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Rousseff, in a separate interview earlier in the week, said she saw the criminal case against Mr. da Silva \u2014 who was convicted of accepting $1.5 million in bribes in the form of a refurbished seaside apartment \u2014 as the latest effort to disenfranchise Brazilian voters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think it would mark the conclusion of the coup,\u201d she said, reiterating her view that her ouster, while procedurally lawful, trampled the will of the electorate.\n\nMs. Rousseff said that the men who conspired to topple her had done a dismal job and become ensnared in new corruption scandals. \u201cIt just so happens that their candidates and leaders are demolished,\u201d she said, sounding pleased.\n\nThat dynamic, she said, has made Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s candidacy plausible, while also lifting the appeal of Mr. da Silva and the Workers\u2019 Party, which took a hit during the economic recession and from the corruption investigations.\n\nMr. da Silva kicked off his campaign with a bus tour through the impoverished states in the country\u2019s northeast, where many residents recall his time in office, which coincided with a commodities boom, as the most prosperous in their lives.\n\nMaria de Fatima Oliveira, 53, a part-time assistant at a funeral home in Cansan\u00e7\u00e3o, a small town in the state of Bahia, said that without the subsidies she began receiving when Mr. da Silva was president, she could not have paid her electricity and gas bills.\n\nLater, during Ms. Rousseff\u2019s tenure, access to medical care expanded in the area with the arrival of Cuban doctors hired by the government on contracts.\n\n\u201cHere in the northeast, we\u2019re Lula and Dilma supporters,\u201d said Ms. Oliveira, who lives in an adobe house on a dirt road. \u201cAll politicians are thieves, but at least when they stole they also gave us back something.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolsonaro has warned that a return to Workers\u2019 Party rule would put Brazil on a ruinous path, pointing to the crisis in Venezuela as a cautionary tale. He has sought to portray himself as the rare experienced Brazilian politician untainted by corruption scandals, although a recent investigative report by a Brazilian newspaper on his real estate holdings raised questions about how he and his sons could have afforded apartments worth $4.6 million on public service salaries.\n\nA former paratrooper, Mr. Bolsonaro first rattled the political establishment in 1993 when, as a newly elected lawmaker, he called for a return to military rule, saying, \u201cI am in favor of a dictatorship.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nUntil recently, Mr. Bolsonaro was largely regarded as a fringe provocateur in Congress with few legislative accomplishments to his name.

While Mr. da Silva has a commanding 36 percent lead in the latest poll by Datafolha, Mr. Bolsonaro is solidly in second place with 18 percent. The December poll has a 2 percent margin of error.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro, who is not backed by a powerful political party, has developed a loyal following among young men and wealthy rural Brazilians. Roberto Folley Coelho, who owns a farm in Mato Grosso do Sul, said that while Mr. Bolsonaro can be crude, he is precisely the type of leader Brazil needs now.\n\n\u201cThe main thing is honesty,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been in politics for 20 years and has had many chances of becoming corrupt, and yet he is not.\u201d\n\nWhile the candidate\u2019s disparagement of women and gays has caused consternation, it is in line with the views of many Brazilians, Mr. Coelho said, adding that Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s tough talk on security appealed to him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOur Constitution from 1988 gave too many rights to criminals \u2014 at the expense of people\u2019s safety,\u201d Mr. Coelho said.", "title": "News Analysis: Leftist Lion and Far-Right Provocateur Vie for Brazil Presidency", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/world/americas/brazil-lula-bolsonaro-election.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T17:23:53Z"}, {"textData": "(KOCABEYLI, Turkey) \u2014 Turkish jets bombed the Kurdish-controlled city of Afrin in northern Syria on Saturday, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to expand Turkey\u2019s military border operations against a Kurdish group that has been the U.S.\u2019s key Syria ally in the war on the Islamic State group.\n\nThe warplanes attacked Afrin shortly before sunset, Turkish media reported. A Kurdish official confirmed the strikes saying they were the first by the Turkish military on the city, in what it has named operation \u201cOlive Branch.\u201d\n\nThe attack comes on the heels of a week of sharp threats by the Turkish government, promising to clear the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, from Afrin and its surrounding countryside, also called Afrin.\n\nTurkey says the YPG \u2014 a group it considers a terrorist organization \u2014 is an extension of an outlawed Kurdish rebel group that it is fighting inside its own borders. It has recruited to its cause thousands of disaffected Syrian opposition fighters, who view the YPG as a counter-revolutionary force in Syria\u2019s multi-sided civil war.\n\nAssociated Press journalists at the Turkish border saw a convoy of buses, believed to be carrying Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters, traveling along the border across from Afrin. The convoy included at least four trucks carrying pickup trucks mounted with machine guns. Video from Turkey this week showed the military moving tanks to the border.\n\nThe YPG is the driving force behind a coalition of north Syrian forces allied with the U.S. to battle the Islamic State group. With U.S. support, including close to 2,000 embedded forces, the coalition now controls close to a quarter of Syrian territory, concentrated mostly in the north east.\n\nTurkish leaders were infuriated by an announcement by the U.S. military announced one week ago that it was going to create a 30,000-strong border force with the Kurdish fighters to secure northern Syria. Days later, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that the U.S. would maintain a military presence with the Kurds for the foreseeable future.\n\nSpeaking in the city of Kutahya in western Turkey, Erdogan announced an expansion to Turkish operations in Syria, promising to move on the Kurdish-controlled town of Manbij and its surrounding countryside after completing operations in Afrin, to force out the Kurdish militia from all positions west of the Euphrates river.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the strikes on Afrin marked the start of a campaign to \u201celiminate the PYD and PKK and Daesh elements in Afrin,\u201d referring to the Kurdish Democratic Union Party and the Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party respectively, and using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. The PYD, PKK, and YPG all look to the Kurdish Marxist-nationalist leader Abdullah \u00d6calan as their guide. Ocalan is imprisoned by Turkey for waging a separatist movement in the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe air strikes were preceded by waves of artillery strikes on the Afrin region.\n\nAny ground operation would entail considerable military and political risk for Ankara. Russia keeps military observers in Afrin and has lately firmed up its ties with the YPG. Syria\u2019s government in Damascus says it will shoot down any Turkish jets on raids in the country. The YPG is estimated to have between 8,000 and 10,000 fighters in Afrin.\n\nTurkey could also face blowback from the Kurdish insurgency within its own borders.\n\nA ground offensive or continued shelling would exacerbate the poor humanitarian situation in Afrin, which is now home to at least 800,000 civilians, including many who arrived fleeing the fighting in other parts of Syria.\n\nTurkey\u2019s military and intelligence chiefs traveled to Moscow on Thursday to discuss Turkey\u2019s planned operation.

Gymnastics, and I assume by now you are very well aware of the weighty responsibility you\u2019ve taken on.\n\nUnfortunately, you\u2019ve taken on an organization that I feel is rotting from the inside, and while this may not be what you thought you were getting into, you will be judged by how you deal with it.\n\nA word of advice: continuing to issue empty statements of empty promises, thinking that will pacify us, will no longer work.\n\nYesterday, U.S.A. Gymnastics announced that it was terminating its lease at the ranch where so many of us were abused. I\u2019m glad that it is no longer a national team training site, but U.S.A. Gymnastics neglected to mention that they had athletes training there the day they released the statement.\n\nU.S.A. Gymnastics, where is the honesty? Where is the transparency? Why must the manipulation continue?\n\nNeither U.S.A. Gymnastics nor the U.S.O.C. have reached out to to express sympathy or even offer support \u2014 not even to ask, \u201cHow did this happen? What do you think we can do to help?\u201d\n\nWhy have I and the others here probably not heard anything from the leadership of the U.S.O.C.? Why has the U.S. Olympic Committee been silent? Why isn\u2019t the U.S.O.C. here right now?\n\nLarry was the Olympic doctor and he molested me at the 2012 London Olympic Games. They say now they applaud those who have spoken out, but it\u2019s easy to say that now. When the brave women started speaking out back then, more than a year after the U.S.O.C. says they knew about Nassar, they were dismissed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the 2016 Olympic Games, the president of the U.S.O.C. said that the U.S.O.C. would not conduct an investigation. It even defended U.S.A. Gymnastics as one of the leaders in developing policies to protect athletes.\n\nThat\u2019s the response a courageous woman gets when she speaks out? And when others joined those athletes and began speaking out with more stories of abuse, were they acknowledged? No. It is like being abused all over again.\n\nI have represented the United States of America in two Olympics and have done so successfully. And both U.S.A. Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize on and celebrate my success. But did they reach out when I came forward? No.\n\nSo at this point, talk is worthless to me. We\u2019re dealing with real lives and the future of our sport. We need to believe this won\u2019t happen again.\n\nFor this sport to go on, we need to demand real change, and we need to be willing to fight for it. It\u2019s clear now that if we leave it up to these organizations, history is likely to repeat itself.\n\nTo know what changes are needed requires us to understand what exactly happened and why it has happened.\n\nThis is a painful process, but it\u2019s the only way to identify all the factors that contributed to this problem and how they can be avoided in the future.\n\nThis is the only way to learn from these mistakes and make gymnastics a safer sport. If ever there was a need to fully understand a problem, it is this one right now. To accept that the problem is limited to just what we know now is irresponsible, delusional even.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEach new day seems to bring a new survivor. We have no idea just how much damage you caused, Larry, and we have no idea how deep these problems go.\n\nNow is the time to acknowledge that the very person who sits here before us now \u2014 who perpetrated the worst epidemic of sexual abuse in the history of sports, who is going to be locked up for a long, long time \u2014 this monster was also the architect of policies and procedures that are supposed to protect athletes from sexual abuse for both U.S.A. Gymnastics and the U.S.O.C.\n\nIf we are to believe in change, we must first understand the problem and everything that contributed to it. Now is not the time for false reassurances. We need an independent investigation of exactly what happened, what went wrong, and how it can be avoided for the future. Only then can we know what changes are needed. Only then can we believe such changes are real.\n\nYour honor, I ask you to give Larry the strongest possible sentence, which his actions deserve. For, by doing so, you will send a message to him and to other abusers that they cannot get away with their horrible crimes. They will be exposed for the evil they are, and they will be punished to the maximum extent of the law.\n\nLet this sentence strike fear in anyone who thinks it is O.K. to hurt another person. Abusers, your time is up.\n\nThe survivors are here, standing tall, and we are not going anywhere.\n\nAnd please, your honor, stress the need to investigate how this happened, so that we can hold accountable those who empowered and enabled Larry Nassar, so we can repair, and once again believe, in this wonderful sport.\n\nMy dream is that one day, everyone will know what the words, \u201cMe too,\u201d signify, but they will be educated and able to protect themselves from predators like Larry, so they will never ever ever have to say the words, \u201cMe too.\u201d", "title": "Full Text of Aly Raisman's Statement - New York Times", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/sports/full-text-of-aly-raismans-statement.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T17:10:00Z"}, {"textData": "Nothing has caused a greater disturbance in the Force than the untimely death of Carrie Fisher.\u00a0\nThe actress and \u201cStar Wars\u201d pillar\u00a0tragically died in December 2016\u00a0at\u00a0the age of 60, and with that came the inevitable question: How will \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d handle her character moving forward.\u00a0\nWell, \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d was released in December 2017, and, as a result, we learned that Leia will live on in the franchise, despite Fisher\u2019s death. There were, however, a few moments in the film that stood out as possible (maybe even unintentional) nods to the actress\u2019\u00a0passing.\nIt all comes down to a specific request Fisher made in\u00a0Wishful Drinking,\u00a0a 2008 book based on her one-woman show:\n\nI tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I wanted it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\n\nNo, there isn\u2019t any bra-strangling going on in \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d (The Porgs would\u2019ve been traumatized.) But there are instances in which the \u201cLast Jedi\u201d filmmakers seem to have heeded Fisher\u2019s request to be \u201cdrowned in moonlight.\u201d First, when Leia appears bathed in light while briefly floating out in space after a First Order attack. And later, when she appears unconscious in a medical bay.\u00a0\n\nDirector Rian Johnson, along with other\u00a0\u201cLast Jedi\u201d crew members, told HuffPost that the scenes \u201cdidn\u2019t change at all\u201d following Fisher\u2019s death\u00a0\u2015 they occur exactly as they intended them to when Fisher was alive. But they admitted that the moments have taken on new meaning since.\nAs for Fisher\u2019s request to be \u201cdrowned in moonlight,\u201d Johnson acknowledged the coincidence, adding that his team decided\u00a0\u201cnot to change [the performance] even though it had some images like that, some moments we had to take a breath and say, \u2018This has a whole extra layer of context now.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt was, for me, a decision of looking at her performance in its entirety, and realizing that if we went in to try to alter it, we inevitably would have to lose some scenes which I thought were scenes that the fans should have \u2015 that people who loved Leia would have,\u201d he said. \u201cI would never have wanted to lose her conversation with Luke or her conversation with Holdo or the final moment with Rey.\u00a0Those are just things that I feel like we deserved to have from Leia in this movie, so that included the scenes where she is lying in her chamber unconscious, and [it\u2019s]\u00a0uncomfortable to watch. It\u2019s also part of the story.\u201d\nVisual Effects supervisor Ben Morris told us that post-production effects were used very sparingly on Fisher\u2019s appearance while she was in space (and in the medical bay), explaining that he only had minor support to add things like ice around her.\n\u201cWhen it needed to be, it was all Carrie,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nA different Fisher moment had film editor Bob Ducsay breaking down even before her death.\n\u201cHer scene with Luke.\u00a0The first time I put the scene together, it was put together and I tracked a little bit of music in it, and I watched it and I got completely choked up. I mean completely choked up. This was sort of me bringing my love of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and thinking about what it would be like. These characters that have been apart for so long and here they are together, brother and sister again. It really affected me emotionally, and that was while Carrie was still with us,\u201d he said.\nDucsay reiterated that audiences bring a \u201cwhole extra level of emotion\u201d to the film now.\n\u201cCarrie is not with us any longer, and I think it really means a lot more to the audience, even though it was going to mean a lot to them as it was\u00a0... but now there\u2019s this extra leap, and it affects me also every time I watch,\u201d he said.\nRegardless of Leia\u2019s fate beyond\u00a0\u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d the film did \u2015 deliberately or not \u2015 give Fisher her moment in the moonlight.\n\n\n\n", "title": "This Carrie Fisher Quote Casts \u2018Last Jedi\u2019 In A Whole New Light", "sourceId": "the-huffington-post", "sourceName": "The Huffington Post", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carrie-fisher-last-jedi-moment-took-on-new-meaning-following-her-death_us_5a38ca39e4b0860bf4aab52d", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T17:07:38Z"}, {"textData": "CLOSE Already falling behind on New Years resolutions? These apps and devices can motivate you to be the 'best you'. Marc Saltzman, special for USA TODAY\n\nThe Fitbit Alta HR. (Photo: Fitbit/handout)\n\nIt\u2019s almost February already, so how\u2019s that New Year\u2019s resolution coming along?\n\nIf you\u2019re human, you might\u2019ve fallen off the bandwagon already \u2013 especially if your goal this year was to lose weight, get fit, be less stressed, or sleep more.\n\nWhy does bacon have to taste so good? Who wants to walk or run outside in this weather? Where are you going to find the time to meditate when there are credit card bills to pay down?\n\nFortunately, technology may help give you the kick in the pants you need.\n\nThe following are a few suggestions on how apps and devices could nudge you in the right direction.\n\nGet moving\n\nA wearable activity tracker (or smartwatch) can help monitor and motivate. The Fitbit Alta HR ($149), for example, is a slim and stylish wristband that tracks your steps, distance, calories burned, and heart rate, and gives friendly reminders to move. As extra incentive, this Fitbit also includes automatic exercise recognition, which gives you credit for being active, while optional smartphone notifications keep you connected throughout the day.\n\nYou can also tailor your look with interchangeable metal, leather, and classic bands (sold separately).\n\nWearable activity trackers are still a recommended way to monitor fitness (and sleep). (Photo: Fitbit handout)\n\nWhile other companies make smart scales, too, Fitbit also has a Wi-Fi-enabled Fitbit Aria 2 ($129), which measures weight, body fat percentage, and body mass index (BMI). Why do you need Wi-Fi? When the data is wirelessly synched from the scale to the Fitbit app on your phone, you can view charts and graphs of your weight loss progress.\n\nMore: People in these cities, countries took the most steps in 2017, Fitbit says\n\nMusic can also be motivating. Available in black or blue, the Bose SoundSport Free Headphones ($249) were created specifically for exercise, as they\u2019re wireless in-ear buds, with secure tips, plus they\u2019re sweat- and weather-resistant. Along with clear and well-balanced audio from your music \u2013 and the ability to play or pause tracks and access your phone\u2019s Siri or Google Assistant \u2013 you can take calls through the right earbud.\n\nBattery life on these Bose earbuds tops 10 hours between charges. Misplaced them? There\u2019s also a handy \u201cFind My Buds\u201d feature on the companion app.\n\nFitness-centric earbuds can help you remain entertained and motiviated. (Photo: Bose/handout)\n\nIn-home equipment is going high-tech, too. The Peloton Bike ($1,995, plus $39/month subscription), for example, lets you stream 14 daily live classes from its NYC studio directly into your home, giving your real-time metrics (including cadence, resistance, output, and heart rate) and encouragement to keep you going. Alternatively, you can access more than 5,000 on-demand workouts, all viewable with the screen (with speakers) mounted on the front of the stationary bike.\n\nAs for apps, MyFitnessPal and Lose It! (iOS and Android) are two of the more popular calorie-counting tools, which lets you log the food you eat throughout the day. While features vary a bit, you can select foods you\u2019ve consumed from the app's huge library of foods, scan barcodes to add packaged foods, and let you know how much more you can eat during the day based on your caloric intake (and yes, if you exercise, it frees up more to eat).\n\nKeep track of your food intake with this popular calorie counter app. (Photo: MyFitnessPal/handout)\n\nAnother good one is Fitness Blender, a free website and app (iOS, Android) that dishes up thousands of fitness videos you can easily browse and watch, divided into areas for strengthening, weight loss, equipment, and so on. The vibrant Fitness Blender community can be equally as motivating, where you can post your goals, ask questions, and share progress and tips, with other likeminded individuals.\n\nOne of the newest self-improvement apps is MoveWith (iOS only; from $7.99/month after free trial), which takes a bit of a different spin on motivating you \u2013 using audio \u2013 to help your \u201cbody, mind, and soul,\u201d says the company. From high-intensity cardio, strength, and running workouts, to mindful yoga and meditation, this app gives you all the benefits of a motivating and instructional coach in your ear, and with relevant music to get you in the zone. Simply choose what you want to work on, select your personal coach, and away you go. MoveWith says they add new audio workouts each week.\n\nSleep better\n\nLet your phone analyze your sleep and wake you up in the lightest sleep phase \u2013 so you feel refreshed instead of jolted. (Photo: SleepCycle/handout)\n\nMost activity trackers don\u2019t only monitor exercise, but sleep behavior, too, such as if you woke up, when, and for how long. The above mentioned Alta HR automatically goes one step further by showing your time spent in light, deep, and Random Eye Movement (REM) sleep.\n\nAnnounced at CES, Philips says it has developed an even better wearable, to address the fact nearly 40% of people ages 25 through 54 get less than the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, says Philips, which could result in concentration and memory challenges.\n\nCalled SmartSleep ($399), it\u2019s comprised of two small sensors that detect periods of important \u201cslow wave\u201d sleep, and then produces customized audio tones in real time that are said to enhance the depth and duration of slow wave sleep.\n\nPhilips says their studies have shown significant success among those who used SmartSleep for two weeks, resulting in being more alert and energized during the day, and with better memory. The product will be available this spring.\n\nTanda\u2019s mattresses help you feel cooler, which could promote faster and longer sleep. (Photo: Tanda/handout)\n\nOn a related note, research reveals cooler temperatures create an optimal environment to help induce sleep (between 65 and 72 degrees). With this in mind, Tanda\u2019s mattresses feature a technology called ATROS, an acronym for Advanced Temperature Regulation for Optimum Sleep. When combined with Opti-Breeze foam, it not only helps you fall asleep faster, says the company, but also works to keep your core body temperature from climbing at night to help you stay asleep longer.\n\nPrices start at $550 for the one of three mattress types, plus there are pillows, too, for $75 (or $125 for the pair).\n\nWhen it comes to apps, Sleep Cycle (iOS, Android) leverages your smartphone\u2019s built-in microphone and accelerometer, which picks up your movements as you sleep using sound and vibration analysis. The app then analyzes the data to determine if you are in light sleep, deep sleep, or a REM dream state \u2013 and then wakes you up at an optimal time (within a 30-minute window that you set). The app attempts to rouse you during your lightest phase of sleep, so that you wake up feeling rested and refreshed.\n\nBe less stressed\n\nAs Seen on Shark Tank, Simple Habit is the best meditation app for busy people, says columnist Marc Saltzman (Photo: Simple Habit)\n\nA few apps can help you with meditation and mindfulness.\n\nBuilt for busy people, Simple Habit (iOS, Android) is an on-demand platform that offers simple 5-minute lessons, featuring more than 1,000 meditations guided by mindfulness teachers from around the world. You can also pick a lesson by series (Drift to Sleep, Sharpen Focus, Meditate in Nature), and by Teacher of your choice (check out Australia\u2019s Kate James, with her soothing voice and helpful instruction).\n\nMore than 50 sessions are free, with the option to upgrade to a Premium version for $11.99/month or $99.99/year. It\u2019s also available through a desktop website, and Simple Habit will remember where you left off.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Headspace \u2014 a \u201cgym membership for the mind\u201d \u2014 that wants to teach you how to meditate in just a few minutes a day.\n\nThis app (iOS, Android) features a clean and easy-to-use interface, and offers a free beginner series called \u201cTake10\u201d \u2013 10 sessions, 10 minutes apiece, over 10 days \u2013 using proven meditation and mindfulness techniques that could help clear your head, reduce stress, sleep better, and enjoy greater overall happiness. The lessons include stat tracking, rewards, and an optional buddy system (for friends to motivate each other).\n\nFor additional sessions, Headspace offers two auto-renewing subscription options: $12.99 per month, or $94.99 per year.\n\nMore: Meditation could be your answer to holiday stress, anxiety and depression\n\nNeed a boost to help you be happier in 2018? The free Happify app (iOS and Android) offers various games and activities to perk you up, on demand, wherever life takes you. You simply need to fill out a short questionnaire to start, to instruct the app on your specific stressors, and it will select a relevant program for you.\n\nChill out\n\nAromatherapy products, including diffusers, can help you relax, plus many include sights and sounds, too. (Photo: Ellia/Handout)\n\nCrafted from ceramic and wood, in a basket-weave design, Ellia\u2019s Gather Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser ($99) can fill your space with the natural scent of essential oils (three samples included, and start at $9.99 after that). Whether you set it and forget it \u2014 with 10 hours of continuous runtime \u2013 or you use the bundled remote to turn it on and off, this aromatherapy gadget also features a color-changing light, and a library of relaxing and uplifting sounds.\n\nAs for your pet\u2019s well-being, technology doesn\u2019t leave them out.\n\nThis anxiety relief system for dogs attempts to keep them calm during stressful times. (Photo: Calmz/handout)\n\nAccording to Calmz, nearly 75 million dogs owned by American families suffer from anxiety at some point in their lives. The Calmz Anxiety Relief System ($99) for dogs is a non-invasive and drug-free treatment that soothes common anxieties, such as loud noises (like thunder and fireworks), strangers in the home, travel, and more.\n\nIt\u2019s a wearable vest, of sorts, that uses \u201cNeuroSync\u201d technology: your dog will hear and feel a therapeutic blend of classical music with a specific tone that results in a calming vibration. This combination of therapies stops the production of adrenaline and increases blood flow to the brain to help reduce anxiety in dogs.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.

French interior minister announces Saturday Jan.20, 2018 that Paul Bocuse, a master of French cuisine, has died at 91. (Laurent Cipriani, File/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 He was modest about his accomplishments in the kitchen but grandiose in his dreams. Paul Bocuse credited his long reign as France\u2019s master chef to everything but himself: good produce fresh from the garden, a superb kitchen staff and happy diners.\n\nBut the three-star Michelin rating held since 1965 by his restaurant outside the French city of Lyon wasn\u2019t enough. Bocuse parlayed his business and cooking skills into a globe-spanning empire, along the way transforming chefs from kitchen artists toiling in the shadows into international celebrities.\n\nBocuse died at 91 on Saturday at Collonges-au-Mont-d\u2019or, the place where he was born and had his restaurant, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. He had undergone a triple heart bypass in 2005 and also suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cFrench gastronomy loses a mythical figure,\u201d Macron said. \u201cThe chefs cry in their kitchens, at the Elysee (presidential palace) and everywhere in France.\u201d\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb tweeted that \u201cMister Paul was France. Simplicity and generosity. Excellence and art de vivre.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has been a leader. He took the cook out of the kitchen,\u201d said celebrity French chef Alain Ducasse, speaking at a 2013 gathering to honor Bocuse, one of more than 100 chefs from around the world who traveled to Lyon for the occasion.\n\n\u201cMonsieur Paul\u201d \u2014 as he was affectionately known \u2014 cultivated a larger-than-life image. The public Bocuse was all white starch, most often portrayed in his tall chef\u2019s hat, or \u201ctoque,\u201d arms folded over his crisp apron.\n\nHe was a tireless pioneer, the first chef to blend the art of cooking with savvy business tactics \u2014 branding his cuisine and his image to create an empire of restaurants around the globe whose offerings range from haute cuisine to fast food.\n\nBut the man dubbed by critics as the \u201cpope of French cuisine\u201d never forgot his humble beginnings learning the ropes in his family kitchen along the Saone River in southeast France. He turned that family house into a temple of gastronomy \u2014 L\u2019Auberge du Pont de Collonges \u2014 and still lived upstairs, sleeping in the same room where he was born, he told The Associated Press in a 2011 interview.\n\n\u201cOne must never forget how one reached the top of the pedestal,\u201d he is quoted as saying in a 2005 biography.\n\nThe restaurant has held three stars \u2014 without interruption \u2014 since 1965 in the Michelin guide, the bible of gastronomes. Bocuse greets arriving guests in a \u201ctromp l\u2019oeuil\u201d painting on an outside wall and peers at them from a large portrait inside the cozy but elegant Auberge. Renowned chefs, some of whom he worked with, are portrayed in a giant mural.\n\nBocuse\u2019s cuisine was simple yet his personality complex. Three women, his wife Raymonde and two other female companions, accompanied his ascension, playing pivotal roles while remaining mostly behind the scenes.\n\nIn 1982, Bocuse opened a restaurant in the France Pavilion in Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida, headed by his son Jerome, also a chef.\n\nBut while excelling in the business of cooking, Bocuse never flagged in his devotion to his first love, creating a top class, quintessentially French meal. He eschewed the fads and experiments that have captivated many other top chefs.\n\n\u201cIn cooking, there are those who are rap and those who are concerto,\u201d he told the French newsmagazine L\u2019Express \u2014 adding that he tended toward the concerto \u2014 a solo artist backed by an orchestra of talented kitchen staff.\n\nIn traditional cooking, there is no room for guesswork he said, declaring \u201cone must be immutable, unattackable, monumental.\u201d\n\nBorn on Feb. 11, 1926, to a family of cooks that he dates to the 1700s, Bocuse entered his first apprenticeship at 16. He worked at the famed La Mere Brazier in Lyon, then spent eight years with one of his culinary idols, Fernand Point, whose cooking was a precursor to France\u2019s nouvelle cuisine movement with lighter sauces and lightly cooked fresh vegetables.\n\nBocuse\u2019s career in the kitchen traversed the ages. He went from apprenticeships and cooking \u201cbrigades\u201d at a time when stoves were coal-fired and chefs also served as scullery workers to the ultra-modern kitchen of his Auberge.\n\n\u201cThere was rigor,\u201d Bocuse told the AP. \u201c(At La Mere Brazier) you had to wake up early and milk the cows, feed the pigs, do the laundry and cook .... It was a very tough school of hard knocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, the profession has changed enormously. There\u2019s no more coal. You push a button and you have heat,\u201d he said.\n\nBocuse adapted seamlessly to the changing times, making his mark with a first coveted Michelin star in 1958, a second in 1960 and a third in 1965. In 1989, he was named Cook of the Century by Gault & Millau, a noted guidebook. In 2011, the Culinary Institute of America named him Chef of the Century, opening a restaurant for students in his name.\n\nDespite the accolades, he maintained a special pride in the blue, white and red stripes on his chef\u2019s collar holding a large medal, attesting to his selection in 1961 as a \u201cMeilleur Ouvrier de France,\u201d a sought-after distinction for chefs and other artisans.\n\nThe gastronomic offerings at Bocuse\u2019s L\u2019Auberge du Pont de Collonges are rooted in the French culinary tradition: simple, authentic food that was \u201cidentifiable\u201d in its nature.\n\nEmblematic of that is the crock of truffle soup he created in 1975 for then-French President Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing \u2014 a soup that is still served to this day. Another Bocuse classic is fricassee of Bresse chicken \u2014 from France\u2019s Bresse region, which is famed for its poultry \u2014 served in cream with morilles, a type of spring mushroom.\n\nAnd his favorite ingredient? Butter.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s a) magical product,\u201d he said during a visit to the Culinary Institute of America. \u201cNothing replaces butter.\u201d\n\nThree other cooking must-haves, according to the chef, are fresh produce (his from his own garden), a solid, trusted kitchen staff and happy diners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the client who runs the house,\u201d Bocuse told the AP.\n\nHe disparaged the notion that his culinary offerings amounted to nouvelle cuisine, although he incorporated aspects of it. And he scoffed at critics who contended that his food was stuck in a bygone age. Georges Auguste Escoffier, who gave classic French cuisine a world profile, remained a solid inspiration at Bocuse\u2019s table.\n\n\u201cEscoffier was the master of us all,\u201d Bocuse once said.\n\nWorld War II interrupted his kitchen duties. He fought in the First Division of the Free French Forces, was wounded and cared for at a U.S. field hospital.\n\n\u201cI always say I have American blood in my veins because ... I had transfusions of American blood,\u201d he said in the AP interview. An American flag still flies outside his restaurant.\n\nThe war had a lasting impact on the chef.\n\n\u201c(It) forges the character,\u201d he said. \u201cYou no longer have the same idea of life.\u201d\n\nBocuse might have settled for being a renowned French chef worthy of a pilgrimage by food lovers with deep pockets. Instead, he parlayed his culinary skills into a worldwide food conglomerate.\n\nHe opened two brasseries in Lyon in 1995 and 1997. He added three other eateries in the city and even a hotel. He planted restaurants in the south of France, in Geneva and hopped across the world to Japan, where eight Bocuse brasseries, cafes and other establishments were opened.\n\nHe also aimed to transmit his savoir-faire to a young generation through the Foundation Paul Bocuse, established in Lyon in 2004 to initiate youth into the cooking profession. His Bocuse d\u2019Or, or gold award \u2014 an international competition for young chefs \u2014 has grown into a major culinary showcase since its inception in 1987.\n\nWhile Bocuse\u2019s kitchens were meticulously in order, his personal life was unorthodox as he quietly shared his life with three women.\n\n\u201cI think cuisine and sex have lots of common points,\u201d Bocuse told the L\u2019Express before publication of his biography \u201cPaul Bocuse: The Sacred Fire.\u201d \u2018\u2019Even if it seems a bit macho, I love women.\u201d\n\nThe chef put an upbeat spin on his private life: \u201cIf I calculate the number of years I\u2019ve been faithful to the three women who count in my life, I get 145 years,\u201d he is quoted as saying in \u201cThe Sacred Fire.\u201d\n\nThe biography was written by Eve-Marie Zizza-Lalu, daughter of the most recent woman in Bocuse\u2019s life, Patricia Zizza, whom he met in 1972.\n\nYet it is his wife Raymonde, with whom Bocuse had a daughter, Francoise, who helps watch over his main restaurant. That is no small task \u2014 Bocuse saw the reservation book as the real measure of any chef\u2019s cuisine.\n\n\u201cIf the restaurant works, if it\u2019s full of clients ... whatever the cuisine, he (the chef) is right,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Bocuse is survived by his daughter Francoise and his son Jerome.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Kim Komando tells you about overlooked features. USA TODAY\n\nGoogle Photos new Shared Libraries feature lets you send an endless photo feed to one special person in your life. (Photo: Google)\n\nMost people think of Google Photos like a dusty old album on the shelf. Every once in a while, you flip through those old snapshots with a friend. Remember that trip to the beach? That was so nice.\n\nLike most Google services, Photos is overflowing with helpful features, which can manipulate, organize, and share your thousands of images. Most impressive of all, you can search through your photos in clever new ways, which shouldn\u2019t be surprising, given Google\u2019s search engine roots.\n\nSpeaking of Google searches, want to get shocked? Click here for the steps to see everything you\u2019ve ever searched for and how to erase it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not using Google Photos, there is one good reason to at least try it. How\u2019d you like to have an unlimited backup of all your photos and videos? There is a catch. To qualify for the unlimited storage, your photos must be less than 16 megapixels. As far as videos go, Google downgrades any video shot above 1080p. Google offers pay plans that provide more storage space for higher quality files.\n\nHere are 20 of the most exciting powers Google Photos users can wield.\n\nDownload all of your photos\n\nGoogle Photos (Photo: Google)\n\nAre you trying to consolidate your photos? You can upload them from your various devices to Google Photos. Then, use Google Takeout, a simple Photos plugin. Takeout lets you download all or some of your Google data. You can select just Photos and even choose exactly which albums to include in the download. Keep in mind this could be a very large download if you have a lot of photos stored. Learn more and get the download links.\n\nGet the Google Photos iOS app\n\nGoogle Photos isn\u2019t just for Android. If you are running out of space on your iPhone or iPad, here\u2019s a possible solution. Download the app for your iOS devices, and you can enjoy the same editing backup, archiving, search, and storage features on your iPad or iPhone.\n\nSee the original photo while editing\n\nHere\u2019s a nifty, under-the-radar feature of the Google Photos app. When you\u2019re editing a photo and playing with a filter, just touch and hold down (or click in a browser) on the image to see the original and quickly compare how the picture first looked. Lift off to see the changed version again.\n\nAutomate backup on your Mac or PC\n\nYou probably don\u2019t even think twice about Google Photos handling images on your smartphone, but what about your Windows or Mac computer? Download Google\u2019s Backup and Sync app for Mac or PC and you can automatically back up images from your desktop or laptop.\n\nWatch for Google Assistant notifications\n\nIf you like surprises, keep an eye out for alerts from the Google Photos assistant feature. It will automatically create stylized photos, collages, and photo albums you might find fun. You can choose to save these automatic creations, ignore them, or delete them. You may also receive \u201cRediscover this day\u201d alerts showing images from a point in the past. It can be a delightful reminder of good times from years ago.\n\nScan your old photos with PhotoScan\n\nHave photos in an album or a frame that you want to make digital? One of the easiest ways to add real photographs to your Google Photos library is to use Google Photoscan for Android and iOS. Follow the on-screen instructions to capture your pictures and then organize and access them with Photos. It\u2019s an easy way to bring vintage photographs into the modern age. Click here to learn more about PhotoScan and get the download links.\n\nMove photos to archive\n\nClear out the clutter by moving unneeded photos to your archive. Just select the three dots to access the photo-options menu and choose \u201cArchive.\u201d Occasionally, Google will automatically suggest photos to move, which you can review and archive as you like.\n\nUn-delete photos\n\nAnil Sabharwal demonstrates updates to Google Photos during the keynote address of the Google I/O conference. (Photo: Eric Risberg, AP)\n\nIf you trashed a photo and now want it back, just open up the main Google Photos menu, select trash, and then choose the image or images you want to restore. Photos remain in the trash for 60 days before being permanently deleted.\n\nChromecast your photos to a TV\n\nIf you have a Chromecast hooked up to your TV, you can open up your Google Photos app on your phone, click on the \u201ccast\u201d icon in the corner, and share your favorite snaps on the big screen for everyone to enjoy.\n\nLink up with Google Drive\n\nBack up your information with Google Drive (Photo: Google handout)\n\nSync your Google Drive with Google Photos by heading to your settings and turning on the Google Drive option. Now you can see and edit photos and videos from Drive right in Photos. Next, head to Google Drive, open the settings and check the option to \u201cCreate a Google Photos folder\u201d to access your images on My Drive.\n\nAdd a photo to a Gmail email\n\nThere\u2019s a super-simple way to add a pic from Google Photos into an email when you\u2019re using Gmail from a web browser. Look for the \u201cInsert Photo\u201d icon at the bottom of the compose window. It looks like a little landscape picture. Click this icon to access your Photos archive and choose which snaps to include.\n\nHide your location from shared photos\n\nGoogle collects location information for photos, which can be very helpful for organizing and searching your archive, but it might not be something you want to reveal when you share images with others. Head to Settings, open your Sharing preferences and select \u201cRemove geolocation in items shared by link\u201d to hide that information for any images or videos you share via a link.\n\nBuild a photo book\n\nCLOSE USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham likes the ease of designing and making photo books using Google Photo. Video by Robert Hanashiro\n\nAs much fun as it is to look at photos on a screen, sometimes you just want to hold a real book in your hand. Use the \u201cPhoto books\u201d feature to build and order physical books stocked with your lovely images.\n\nMake an animation\n\nReady to get moving? Select \u201cAssistant\u201d in Photos, choose \u201cAnimation,\u201d and then select anywhere from two to 50 photos and let Google create a fun animation from the images. This is especially entertaining if you have a sequence of action shots that go together.\n\nCreate a slideshow movie\n\nLook under the \u201cAssistant\u201d feature in your Google Photos app for the \u201cMovie\u201d option. This lets you select up to 50 photos or videos to put into a slideshow video. You can customize your creation by choosing different filters and selecting a soundtrack. Google offers a selection of fun tracks ranging from dogs barking \u201cBlue Danube\u201d to upbeat jazzy tunes. You can share your movie creation with friends or publish it to social media or YouTube.\n\nThe power of search\n\nGoogle applies its high-level search expertise to sorting your photos, so you can search by location or look for particular objects. For example, \u201ccamping\u201d or \u201ctent\u201d should pull up images of your outdoor adventures while \u201cHawaii\u201d should bring up your fabulous vacation shots.\n\nLocate photos using dates\n\nIf you use Photos in a web browser, then look for the subtle timeline of dates along the side. You can use this to quickly navigate to a specific period. You can also type a month or year or even a specific date into the search box to find photos.\n\nFind your adorable pet pictures\n\nA photo of \"Papa\" from the Dog Bowl, an offshoot of Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl that helps raise awareness for adopting older dogs. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nGoogle uses machine learning to visually sort out different pets. So go ahead and search your photos by \u201ccat,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d or even \u201ctabby\u201d or \u201cgolden retriever.\u201d The system isn\u2019t perfect, but it works surprisingly well.\n\nLabel people by name\n\nClick on the search bar and look for the row of faces that appear in little round circles. Click on a face and you now have an option to add a name by typing it in or choosing it from your contacts. Pro tip: you can also name your pets this same way.\n\nSearch by emoji\n\nPop open your Google Photos app, go to the search bar, and, instead of typing in text, choose an emoji for your search term. A cat emoji will return feline photos, a happy-face emoji will get pictures of smiling people, and a birthday cake will give you birthday-related images. This might not be the most practical way to search your photos, but it sure is fun.\n\nWhat questions do you have? Call my national radio show and click here to find it on your local radio station.

She is also, after beating Sharapova, the last major singles women\u2019s champion left heading into the round of 16. Kerber, a German, will face Hsieh Su-wei, a 32-year-old from Taiwan who is known best for her doubles prowess.\n\n\u201cAngie is already one step ahead of everybody else because nobody else knows what it\u2019s like to win a Grand Slam,\u201d said the Australian Rennae Stubbs, a television analyst and former player. \u201cIt\u2019s bloody hard to do it. It\u2019s nerve-racking and it\u2019s stressful and it\u2019s out-of-this-world different, and she\u2019s already won two and won here and she\u2019s playing great. She\u2019s nails right now. She\u2019s 2016 all over again.\u201d\n\nSharapova, who will turn 31 in April, has farther to go to crank back her clock. Since returning last season from a 15-month suspension for an antidoping violation, she has not gotten past the fourth round in the two major tournaments she has played.\n\nOnce No. 1, she is closing in on the top 40 again. It would be quite a surprise if Sharapova, a Russian, were not one of the 32 seeds at the French Open, the next major tournament, which begins in Paris in May.\n\nBut her first serve was a liability on Saturday night, when she put just 38 percent into play. And though she generated plenty of her signature pace and acoustic fury, she was not nearly steady enough or acrobatic enough to keep up in this match. Kerber kept her off balance as a rule and countered her flat power effectively when Sharapova was able to deliver groundstrokes from more solid platforms.\n\n\u201cAngie knew it would be a tough one mentally, but if she plays like that, with aggression, she\u2019s just a better player than Maria right now because of her movement,\u201d Barbara Rittner, the German Fed Cup captain, said after chatting with Kerber as she warmed down from the match on a stationary bike.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKerber\u2019s new coach, Wim Fissette, was also part of the debriefing and is again having a quick impact on a new pupil. Fissette, a Belgian who started his WTA Tour coaching career working with Kim Clijsters, has since experienced success with Halep, Victoria Azarenka and Johanna Konta.\n\nBut he split with Konta last year, and when Kerber split with her longtime coach Torben Beltz, she recruited Fissette \u2014 in part because of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and in part because he speaks German.\n\nKerber said Fissette was her first choice, and they are now off to a flying start. She has won 12 straight matches to start the season: four of them unofficial at the Hopman Cup team event and eight of them on tour.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different voice,\u201d Kerber said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different than with Torben, but you know, I think I needed the change, and that\u2019s why I decided to change everything.

I have to dig deep, and digging deep wins me matches and then that gives me confidence and that reminds me I\u2019m really good.\u2019 And then everybody starts talking, \u2018Angie\u2019s back!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe risk, of course, is that Kerber starts hearing that chorus so often that she begins to think too hard again instead of just reacting and hustling and letting her beautiful game flow.\n\n\u201cI think she plays extremely well when she has a lot of matches behind her back,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cI always thought she\u2019s a confidence player.\u201d", "title": "Angelique Kerber Is Learning How to Win Again - New York Times", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/sports/tennis/australian-open-angelique-kerber-maria-sharapova.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T16:17:00Z"}, {"textData": "LeBron James and Dwyane Wade are taking a light-hearted approach to the fact that trade rumors are swirling around the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nMultiple reports surfaced on Friday that the Cavs are kicking the tires on Sacramento\u2019s George Hill, as well as DeAndre Jordan and Lou Williams of the Clippers.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s an ambitious wishlist for the Cavs. While continuity has been pointed to by multiple players and head coach Tyronn Lue as reasons for their struggles, prominent players anonymously expressed after their loss Monday to Golden State that they didn\u2019t believe the current team could compete with the Warriors are currently constructed.\n\nOf course, when things like this happen, twitter comes in with the jokes.

One of them is Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for hiring women into often vaguely defined but closely held roles.\n\n\u201cWomen, according to Trump, were simply more loyal and trustworthy than men,\u201d Mr. Wolff writes. \u201cMen might be more forceful and competent, but they were also more likely to have their own agendas. Women, by their nature, or Trump\u2019s version of their nature, were more likely to focus their purpose on a man. A man like Trump.\u201d Mr. Trump, the author continued, \u201cneeded special \u2014 extra-special \u2014 handling. Women, he explained to one friend with something like self-awareness, generally got this more precisely than men. In particular, women who self-selected themselves as tolerant of or oblivious to or amused by or steeled against his casual misogyny and constant sexual subtext \u2014 which was somehow, incongruously and often jarringly, matched with paternal regard \u2014 got this.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cemotional labor\u201d gets vastly overused, but this is a textbook example. The women who work for Mr. Trump aren\u2019t just required to perform their professional tasks; they also have to coddle and care for a volatile patriarch.\n\nDonald Trump doesn\u2019t just have a woman problem; he has a work wife problem.\n\nAt some point in the past few years, the terms \u201cwork wife\u201d and \u201cwork husband\u201d sneaked into the lexicon, describing what are typically benign workplace intimacies: a close co-worker with whom you share not only tasks but also complaints and office gossip. When these relationships reflect a modern marital dynamic of egalitarian husband and wife forging forward as a team, \u201cwork husbands\u201d and their \u201cwork wives\u201d can be healthy platonic partnerships. But as women who work know, egalitarianism is not always the norm, and many of us have found ourselves serving as the caretaking \u201cwork wife\u201d to the emotionally needier male co-worker or superior. This is common dynamic, if a seldom-addressed one (it certainly went unmentioned by the \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d author, Ivanka Trump, who occupies this very role in her father\u2019s professional world).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProfessional women always walk a balance beam of respect, pushed to excel without seeming ambitious, pulled by social expectations of female niceness tempered by concerns that female likability exists in opposition to perceptions of female competence, inevitably blown off-kilter. What Mr. Trump demands of his female subordinates, though, is something greater than your still-sexist but wholly run-of-the-mill concerns about gendered expectations in the workplace. Women like Ivanka Trump, Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway don\u2019t just counsel the president and liaise with the press and public; they offer a feminine salve, simultaneously sanctioning Mr. Trump\u2019s sexist commentary and buttressing his ego by situating themselves as little girls in need of direction from Big Daddy (literally, in Ivanka\u2019s case). In return, Mr. Trump\u2019s usual hostility may be temporarily eased into something resembling benevolence toward them.\n\nHostile sexism \u2014 hateful misogynist comments or the physical abuse of women, for example \u2014 is easy to identify and condemn. (And to be clear, Mr. Trump has displayed plenty of that, too.) Benevolent sexism is more insidious. In the view of the benevolent sexist, women and men should occupy fundamentally different roles, with the men as patriarchs and women, with our naturally maternal and gentle dispositions, as helpmates and caretakers. In some conservative, religious or simply strongly male-dominated communities, you see this dressed up as a form of feminism \u2014 the idea being that women can find respect and purpose by tapping into our intrinsic maternal nature. When Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders use the fact that the president has employed and encouraged a handful of women \u2014 to, as we now know, also serve as his uncompensated therapists \u2014 as a shield against accusations of sexism, they are deploying a similarly mendacious argument.", "title": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer: Donald Trump and His Work Wives", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/opinion/donald-trump-and-his-work-wives.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T16:13:43Z"}, {"textData": "The Arizona Cardinals do not yet have a new coach, so of course they do not know who their offensive coordinator will be.

In September, Mr. Trump moved to end an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that shielded those immigrants from deportation.

The blood tests found about 70 percent of eight common types of cancer in the 1,005 patients. The rates varied depending on the type \u2014 lower for breast tumors but high for ovarian, liver and pancreatic ones.\n\nIn many cases, the test narrowed the possible origin of the cancer to one or two places, such as colon or lung, important for limiting how much follow-up testing a patient might need. It gave only seven false alarms when tried on 812 others without cancer.\n\nThe test is nowhere near ready for use yet; it needs to be validated in a larger study already underway in a general population, rather than cancer patients, to see if it truly works and helps save lives \u2014 the best measure of a screening test\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very, very excited and see this as a first step,\u201d said Nickolas Papadopoulos, one of the Hopkins study leaders. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want people calling up\u201d and asking for the test now, because it\u2019s not available, he said.\n\nSome independent experts saw great promise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a good first set of results\u201d that it gives hope this approach will pan out, said Dr. Peter Bach, a health policy expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who consults for a gene testing company. \u201cAnything close to 50 percent or 40 percent detection is pretty exciting stuff,\u201d and this one did better than that, he said.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, was encouraged that the test did well on cancers that lack screening tests now. If a blood test could find 98 percent of ovarian cancers at an early stage, as these early results suggest, \u201cthat would be a significant advance,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he cautioned: \u201cWe have a long way to go to demonstrate its effectiveness as a screening test.\u201d\n\nTESTING THE TEST\n\nThe test detects mutations in 16 genes tied to cancer and measures eight proteins that often are elevated when cancer is present.\n\nIt covers breast, colon and lung and five kinds that don\u2019t have screening tests for people at average risk: ovarian, liver, stomach, pancreatic and esophageal. Prostate cancer is not included. A blood test already is widely used \u2014 the PSA test \u2014 but its value for screening is controversial.\n\nResearchers tried the new test on people whose cancers were still confined to where it started or had spread a little but not widely throughout the body. It detected 33 percent of breast cancers, about 60 percent of colon or lung cancers and nearly all of the ovarian and liver ones. It did better when tumors were larger or had spread. It did less well at the very earliest stage.\n\nCAVEATS AND NEXT STEPS\n\nThe test probably will not work as well when tested in a general population rather than those already known to have cancer, researchers say. Hopkins and Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania have started a study of it in 10,000 Geisinger patients who will be tracked for at least five years.\n\nThe work was financed by many foundations, the Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which provides The Associated Press with funding for health and science coverage. Many study leaders have financial ties to gene testing companies, and some get royalties for patents on cancer detection methods.\n\nResearchers say the test could cost around $500 based on current materials and methods, but the ultimate goal is to commercialize it, so what a company would charge is unknown.\n\nOTHER LIQUID BIOPSY NEWS\n\nAlso this week, Taiwan-based CellMax Life gave results on its liquid biopsy test, which looks for whole tumor cells shed into blood, at an American Society of Clinical Oncology conference.\n\nResearchers tested 620 people getting colonoscopies or with confirmed colon cancer at a hospital in Taiwan.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nA year ago, Donald Trump used his opening moments as the 45th U.S. president to set forth a radically altered vision for the superpower in the world \u2014 one he dubbed \u201cAmerica first.\u201d\n\nSupporters say he has delivered: a military defeat of the Islamic State, greater spending by U.S. allies on defense and a commitment to transform or abandon international agreements such as NAFTA, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.\n\nBut the \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach has also left the United States far more isolated. The overall impact of the policy, say diplomats, politicians and analysts interviewed around the world, has been a clear retrenchment of U.S. power \u2014 and an opportunity for U.S. adversaries such as China and Russia.\n\nThe American role in the world has been diminishing for years as other countries have expanded their economies, militaries and ambitions.\n\nForeign-policy players, however, say they see something different now: a disorderly U.S. transformation from a global leader working with partners to try to shape the world to an inwardly focused superpower that defines its international role more narrowly. The Trump administration has emphasized counterterrorism and American economic advantage in its foreign policy, while downgrading such traditional U.S. priorities as promoting human rights, democracy and international development.\n\n[Timeline: How the Trump administration changed American foreign policy]\n\nTrump\u2019s approach has won praise from countries including Israel and Saudi Arabia but is strikingly unpopular in many nations: A Gallup survey of attitudes in 134 countries that was released Thursday showed a dramatic drop in support for U.S. leadership in the world, from a median of nearly half of people approving under President Barack Obama to fewer than a third doing so under Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat he has achieved is a remarkable weakening of America\u2019s moral standing,\u201d said Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chair of the German Parliament\u2019s foreign relations committee and an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s. \u201c \u2018America first\u2019 has made America weaker in the world.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to a detailed request for comment.\n\nAcross the globe, U.S. adversaries are rushing to fill the America-size void left as Washington breaks from its closest allies on trade and other international pacts. They also seek to take advantage of the confusion caused by what allies and foes alike have called an ill-defined and sometimes chaotic U.S. foreign policy, broadcast by Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a vacuum now,\u201d said a U.S. official who works on Middle East issues, and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment freely. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to have some try to step in.\u201d\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s vice minister of commerce, Wang Shouwen, third left, speaks during a general session of the Business Forum at the 11th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization in Buenos Aires on Dec. 12, 2017. (Juan Mabromata/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAt a World Trade Organization meeting last month in Buenos Aires, that someone was China.\n\nThe meeting, a biennial affair, usually delivers bromides about the advantages of global commerce along with some tweaks to the system.\n\nThis time, though, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer delivered a combative speech, accusing members of unfairly taking advantage of the group\u2019s rules \u2014 an echo of the president\u2019s oft-repeated denunciation of \u201cdumb trade deals.\u201d\n\nAllies said they got the message: The United States was not there to find common ground.\n\n\u201cThe whole U.S. delegation, not only Lighthizer, at all meetings and bilaterals, made clear in a very explicit way no joint declaration or a common work program could be agreed from the U.S. side,\u201d said an official involved in the negotiations.\n\nAttendees watched as Chinese officials advocated more forcefully for free trade \u2014 and then worked the sidelines to seek deals with other nations, according to a senior European official who was at the meeting.\n\n\u201cYou see them active everywhere,\u201d the official said, adding that the buzz of Chinese activity was clear from the scores of meeting rooms the Chinese delegation booked.\n\nIn a statement, Lighthizer said that he was ready to make worthwhile deals but that poor agreements weaken the global trading system.\n\n\u201cIt is fatuous for the Europeans to blame the United States for the failure of the WTO to arrive at negotiated outcomes in Buenos Aires,\u201d Lighthizer said. \u201cThe E.U. approach \u2014 which is to agree to a deal simply for the sake of doing so \u2014 is antithetical to the global trading system. And to be clear, China got nothing from the ministerial.\u201d\n\nTrade is not the only area in which China has seen opportunity. The emerging superpower also has benefited from a storm of acrimony in recent weeks between Washington and Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation that has long had a tense partnership with the United States.\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson escorts Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif at the State Department in Washington on Oct. 4, 2017. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs Trump has tweeted about the \u201clies and deceit\u201d of the Pakistani government and his administration suspended nearly $2 billion in military aid, China has gleefully stepped in to offer support. Among their actions, the Chinese have committed in recent years to a $62 billion infrastructure plan in the region. Pakistan has taken pains to differentiate between the two powers.\n\n\u201cChina is a strategic partner, while the ties with Washington are tactical,\u201d said Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the defense committee in the Pakistani Senate.\n\nMany diplomats and policymakers say they think Washington will remain the preeminent global power but with greatly dimmed ambitions \u2014 even after Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is not the reinsurance company for the global order. It\u2019s no longer the guarantor of last resort,\u201d said Reinhard B\u00fctikofer, a German member of the European Parliament who works on transatlantic issues. \u201cIf the beacon on the hill doesn\u2019t shine anymore, that has an impact.\u201d\n\nThe impact can be seen in the fact that even longtime U.S. allies such as India, Turkey and Latin American nations are casting about elsewhere for dependable friends. Indian leaders have worked to deepen strategic relationships with Japan, Australia, Israel and other countries. Mexico, meanwhile, has accelerated free-trade talks with Argentina, Brazil and Europe.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory threw Mexico into a near state of emergency. Several key Trump goals \u2014 building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, deporting more illegal immigrants and radically altering the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA \u2014 could pose acute threats to Mexico\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\nFrom left: Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer and Mexican Secretary of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal at a news conference on NAFTA in Washington on Oct. 17, 2017. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe country\u2019s worst fears have not been realized, but avoiding a crisis takes constant effort.\n\n\u201cA bloody roller coaster,\u201d in the words of a Mexican official, \u201ctrying to read between the lines, between the tweets, between the different messages coming from whomever you spoke to last, including the president himself, then trying to decide what to make out of it.\u201d\n\nR\u00f6ttgen said that Trump was so unpredictable that some European leaders had become more cautious about seeking to meet with him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s open to accidents. It\u2019s unpredictable. It\u2019s always seen from a transactional viewpoint,\u201d he said.\n\nA top adviser to one European leader said they no longer try to schedule time with Trump on the sidelines of summits. \u201cAlways, you\u2019re looking for a chance to meet up with the U.S. president,\u201d the adviser said. But now, that leader communicates via lower-level, less-volatile U.S. officials, the adviser said.\n\nStill, most of Washington\u2019s closest European allies continue to seek discussions with the president. Norway\u2019s prime minister visited the White House this month. French President Emmanuel Macron is seeking a meeting with Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos in the coming week. And leaders who once fretted that Trump would abandon some of Washington\u2019s core international commitments are now reassured by robust U.S. troop deployments across Europe.\n\nBut even those who enthusiastically embraced the Trump administration have been nonplused by the president\u2019s style and decisions.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump listens while Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi makes a statement for the media before a meeting at the Palace Hotel during the 72nd U.N. General Assembly on Sep. 20, 2017, in New York. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nEarly in Trump\u2019s tenure, for example, Egyptian officials sensed they finally had a U.S. president who understood them. The Obama administration had been reviled by the government of President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi for its focus on human rights and democracy.\n\nBut confusing U.S. policy moves and Trump\u2019s tweets have proved frustrating \u2014 and alienating. By August, Egyptians were fuming after the U.S. government, citing human rights concerns, cut or delayed nearly $300 million in assistance. Then came the decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and relocate the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cNow we have a situation where the words are not enough,\u201d said the U.S. official who works on Middle East issues. \u201cIn the early days of the administration, the words meant something. President Trump\u2019s praise of Sissi meant something. Now, between the August decision and the Jerusalem decision, they have lost faith.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s policies still win praise in some quarters. Saudi officials enthusiastically greeted him in a May visit, delighted that Trump had rejected Obama-era policies that were less hawkish toward Iran. And in Israel, views of the United States have markedly improved under Trump, who has been far more supportive of the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than Obama was.\n\n\u201c[Trump] has brought fresh thinking to the White House,\u201d said Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely. \u201cHe understands the region better than those experts who warned that if he recognizes Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital or moves the embassy to Jerusalem, the Middle East will explode. It did not explode.\u201d\n\n\n\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip clash with Israeli security forces near the border fence east of Gaza City on Dec. 15, 2017, in response to President Trump\u2019s Dec. 6 declaration of U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. (NurPhoto/Getty Images)\n\nBut prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, already dim, have evaporated.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be peace \u2014 no negotiations, no normalization, and the Middle East will be sitting on a volcano\u201d until the decision is reversed, said Nabil Abu Rudeinah, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nThe Trump administration has escalated the U.S. offensive against Islamist insurgents in places including Somalia and Afghanistan, and gave American military commanders more latitude in decision-making as they fought the Islamic State extremist group in Iraq.\n\nIn Somalia, the U.S. military carried out at least 34 airstrikes in 2017 compared with roughly 14 in 2016. But some officials at the State Department have raised questions about the amplified Pentagon role. There has not been a proportionate increase in diplomatic activity in Somalia. Instead, the size of the U.S. diplomatic mission has shrunk, and the U.S. ambassadorship there has not been filled.\n\nAirstrikes and other military action can have knock-on effects that politically savvy experts could help avert, but \u201cbecause the department\u2019s footprint is so limited compared to the military engagement, diplomats lack the bandwidth,\u201d said a former State Department official.\n\nA similar dynamic is at play in Afghanistan.\n\nAt a ceremony in Kandahar in November to showcase refurbished Black Hawk helicopters being provided to the Afghan government, the top U.S. military commander, Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., gave an upbeat speech about defeating Taliban insurgents.\n\nBut off to one side, a group of invited local elders, clad in turbans and robes, conferred in worried whispers over an entirely different issue.\n\n\u201cWe must speak to him about the elections. Everyone is very worried,\u201d one elder said.\n\nAs soon as Nicholson and his interpreter had sat down, the group bombarded him with concerns, saying that the plans for national elections in July were being undermined by political pressures, ethnic bias and other problems. If the Americans did not intervene, they warned him, the elections could turn into a disaster.\n\n\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, center, and U.S. Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., second right, at the handing over of two Black Hawk helicopters by the U.S. government to the Afghan government at Kandahar Airfield on Oct. 7, 2017. (Massoud Hossaini/AP)\n\nNicholson smiled and promised to pass on their concerns. But the general\u2019s mandate does not include politics, and there has been far less diplomatic focus on Afghanistan than was the case under Obama. The country was without a U.S. ambassador until last month, and a special U.S. envoy post has been scrubbed.\n\nOver the past year, some U.S. allies have said they worried about being kept in the dark as the U.S. government developed its plans for military action. A delegation of senior E.U. ambassadors responsible for security policy for the 28-nation group traveled to Washington in late June and sought details from U.S. officials about the new administration\u2019s foreign policy. One said he returned to Europe \u201cin despair.\u201d\n\nThe diplomat said he received no useful guidance about the administration\u2019s strategy in Iran, Syria or Afghanistan \u2014 or, crucially, about how to interpret the president\u2019s increasingly belligerent tweets aimed at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe war of words between Washington and Pyongyang dominates a long list of apprehensions for U.S. allies for 2018 but is seen as an opportunity for others.\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s volatile brand of dealmaking and brinkmanship, Moscow has sought to present itself as a trustworthy interlocutor.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in September that Moscow was ready to mediate the dispute between Trump and Kim, which he likened to a \u201ckindergarten fight.\u201d\n\nSome officials have noted the irony of Russia and China presenting themselves as guarantors of stability and global free trade.\n\nWhen the Trump administration last January pulled out of negotiations over a 12-nation trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 11 would-be members of the pact were left to work out the details without U.S. input. The deal had long been seen as an alternative to a Chinese regional economic order.\n\n\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping at a bilateral meeting with President Trump at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Nov. 9, 2017.

(Thomas Peter/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. exit gave Chinese President Xi Jinping, the authoritarian leader of one of the world\u2019s most tightly controlled economies, the chance to present himself as a champion of globalization.\n\nThe Chinese \u201chaven\u2019t had to spend any energy to emerge much more clearly as the global leader that they aspire to be,\u201d said David Rank, who resigned as acting U.S. ambassador to China over the administration\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord.\n\nMeanwhile, Rank said, U.S. influence is ebbing.\n\n\u201cFor my entire career except for the last four days of it, the question in foreign capitals, was \u2018What does Washington think about this?\u2019 \u201d Rank said. \u201cI suspect that is not the case anymore.\u201d\n\nBirnbaum reported from Brussels and Paris.

(Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWith airstrikes and artillery fire, Turkey on Saturday defied U.S. appeals and opened a long-anticipated offensive on \u00adAfrin, an enclave in Syria for Kurdish militias backed by the United States.\n\nTurkish officials have framed the offensive as part of a wider battle against Kurdish separatists, known as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, in Turkey\u2019s southeast. Turkey also fears any gains in strength by the Syrian Kurds, whose territory runs along some of Turkey\u2019s southern border.\n\nBut the United States has opted to back the Syrian Kurds as proxy fighters against the Islamic State and as a buffer to keep the militants from trying to reclaim territory.\n\nThe military action immediately raised concerns that it could spark conflicts among the assortment of foreign military powers present, in proximity, across northern Syria. They include Turkey, Russia and the United States. All have the Islamic State as a common foe, but, individually, they back different factions among the various armed groups in Syria.\n\nThe latest flash point also highlighted the shifting disputes and conflicting agendas that have complicated any efforts toward ending nearly seven years of conflict in Syria. The Turkish military action came amid intensifying violence in the northern Syrian province of Idlib, where Syrian government forces are on the offensive against al-Qaeda-aligned rebels in the east of the province.\n\nRecent statements by U.S. military officials about plans to train border security forces that would protect a Kurdish enclave in Syria also provoked Turkey\u2019s ire.\n\n\u201cWe are taking these steps to ensure our own national security,\u201d President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in comments carried by the semiofficial Anadolu agency.\n\nYet Turkish incursions could carry risks. The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had warned that it was prepared to fire on Turkish warplanes in the event of an attack on Afrin.\n\n[U.S. gives mixed signals on Kurdish force as Turkey escalates pressure]\n\nA Syrian government offensive is causing one of the worst surges in population displacement since Syria\u2019s civil war began. More than 212,000 people have fled fighting around Idlib in the past month, many of them sleeping in the open as temperatures plunge and rain drenches makeshift campsites, according to the United Nations.\n\nOn Saturday, hours after the announcement of the airstrikes, Turkey said it had struck more than 100 positions belonging to Kurdish fighters. The number of casualties was not immediately clear. The airstrikes followed days of intense Turkish artillery fire on Kurdish positions, according to residents in Afrin.\n\nIn a statement, the U.S.-backed Kurdish force, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, warned that the Turkish offensive \u201cthreatens to breathe new life into Daesh,\u201d using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State militant group.\n\nThe Trump administration, in urging NATO-ally Turkey not to attack, had made a similar argument, saying it would distract from the ongoing battles against Islamic State militants in their remaining strongholds in Syria. There are roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria.\n\nRussia, which backs Assad\u2019s government, said it was watching developments \u201cwith concern\u201d and called on the warring sides to \u201cexercise mutual restraint.\u201d Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that an unspecified number of Russian troops had been moved out of the Afrin area and redeployed.\n\nMuch about the Turkish offensive, which the government dubbed \u201cOperation Olive Branch,\u201d remained unclear Saturday, including whether it would be accompanied by a substantial push by Turkish ground forces and allied rebel factions.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that no one knows what they intend to do,\u201d said Aaron Stein, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAfrin will be hostile to a Turkish-backed force patrolling from permanent garrisons.

I understood her to some degree.\"\n\n'Eighth Grade' stars Josh Hamilton, left, and Elsie Fisher, and writer/director Bo Burnham. (Photo: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\nWhile most of Kayla's growing pains are universal to anyone who's been in middle school, Burnham doesn't shy away from some of the more unsettling aspects of being a kid in the digital era. Attempting to woo a cute boy in class, Kayla lies through her teeth about having nude pictures and looks up videos on how to give oral sex. She also endures a leering game of truth or dare with a high-school senior, who pressures her to take off her shirt \u2014 a particularly upsetting interaction to watch that has added resonance in the #MeToo era, as some journalists have already pointed out on Twitter.\n\n\"The idea of being young and taken advantage of by someone older than you is not foreign to me, personally,\" Burnham said. \"But I felt that it\u2019s true and something that happens, and needed to be shown.\" His intent was to \"portray a certain type of toxic male behavior that advertises itself as sweet and sensitive, but is anything but. ... It\u2019s a really uncomfortable scene. We just tried to approach it very sensitively and honestly.\"\n\nEighth Grade has so far been well received by critics and audience members at Sundance, with much of the credit for the film's success going to Fisher, 14, who appears in every scene. Although dissimilar personality-wise, the young actress' own experience with the movie closely mirrors that of Kayla's: she graduated eighth grade a week before shooting, and started high school a week after production wrapped.\n\n\"It's really perfect, because I was able to take from my experiences just coming from eighth grade and my actual final week, and translate them into this,\" Fisher said.\n\nAsked how she likes high school, she was charmingly ambivalent: \"It's cool. Not my favorite.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2EW76i4", "title": "Sundance: \u2018Eighth Grade\u2019 is the sweet, cringe-worthy anti-\u2018Lady Bird\u2019", "sourceId": "usa-today", "sourceName": "USA Today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/01/20/sundance-eighth-grade-sweet-cringe-worthy-anti-lady-bird/1050720001/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T15:26:41Z"}, {"textData": "(PARIS) \u2014 Paul Bocuse, the master chef who defined French cuisine for nearly half a century and put it on tables around the world, a man who raised the profile of top chefs from invisible kitchen artists to international celebrities, has died at 91, French officials announced.\n\nOften referred to as the \u201cpope of French cuisine,\u201d Bocuse was a tireless pioneer, the first chef to blend the art of cooking with savvy business tactics \u2014 branding his cuisine and his image to create an empire of restaurants around the globe. His imposing physical stature and his larger-than-life personality matched his bold dreams and his far-flung accomplishments.\n\nBocuse died Saturday at Collonges-au-Mont-d\u2019or, the place where he was born and had his restaurant, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFrench gastronomy loses a mythical figure \u2026 The chefs cry in their kitchens, at the Elysee (presidential palace) and everywhere in France,\u201d Macron said.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb tweeted that \u201cMister Paul was France. Simplicity and generosity. Excellence and art de vivre.\u201d\n\nBocuse, who underwent a triple heart bypass in 2005, had also been suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nBocuse\u2019s temple to French gastronomy, L\u2019Auberge du Pont de Collonges, outside the city of Lyon in southeastern France, has held three stars \u2014 without interruption \u2014 since 1965 in the Michelin guide, the bible of gastronomes.\n\nAs early as 1982, Bocuse opened a restaurant in the France Pavilion in Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida, headed by his son Jerome, also a chef. In recent years, Bocuse even dabbled in fast food with two outlets in his home base of Lyon.\n\n\u201cHe has been a leader. He took the cook out of the kitchen,\u201d said celebrity French chef Alain Ducasse, speaking at a 2013 gathering to honor Bocuse. More than 100 chefs from around the world traveled to Lyon for the occasion \u2014 one of a string of such honors bestowed on Bocuse in recent years.\n\n\u201cMonsieur Paul,\u201d as he was known, was placed right in the center of 2013 cover of the newsweekly Le Point that exemplified \u201cThe French Genius.\u201d Shown in his trademark pose \u2014 arms folded over his crisp white apron, a tall chef\u2019s hat, or \u201ctoque,\u201d atop his head \u2014 he was winged by Marie Curie, Louis Pasteur and Coco Chanel, among other French luminaries.\n\nWhile excelling in the business of cooking, Bocuse never flagged in his devotion to his first love, creating a top class, quintessentially French meal. He eschewed the fads and experiments that captivated many other top chefs.\n\n\u201cIn cooking, there are those who are rap and those who are concerto,\u201d he told the French newsmagazine L\u2019Express before his 2005 biography, adding that he tended toward the concerto.\n\nIn traditional cooking like his, he said, there is no room for guess work.\n\n\u201cOne must be immutable, unattackable, monumental,\u201d he declared.\n\nBorn into a family of cooks that he dates to the 1700s, Bocuse stood guard over the kitchen of his world-famous restaurant even in retirement, keeping an eye on guests, sometimes greeting them at table.\n\nThe red-and-green Auberge by the Saone River, his name boldly set atop the roof, is a temple to Bocuse \u2014 who was born there \u2014 and to other great chefs. Bocuse waves to arriving guests in a \u201ctromp l\u2019oeuil\u201d painting on an outside wall and peers at them from a large portrait inside the cozy Auberge that once belonged to his parents and remained his home. Renowned chefs, some of whom he worked with, are portrayed in a giant mural.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, Bocuse said he slept in the room where he was born above the dining rooms. \u201cBut I changed the sheets,\u201d he added with characteristic wry humor.\n\nBorn on Feb. 11, 1926, Bocuse entered his first apprenticeship at 16. He worked at the famed La Mere Brazier in Lyon, then spent eight years with one of his culinary idols, Fernand Point, whose cooking was a precursor to France\u2019s nouvelle cuisine movement, with lighter sauces and lightly cooked fresh vegetables.\n\nBocuse\u2019s career in the kitchen traversed the ages. He went from apprenticeships and cooking \u201cbrigades,\u201d as kitchen teams are known, when stoves were coal-fired and chefs also served as scullery maids, to the ultra-modern kitchen of his Auberge.\n\n\u201cThere was rigor,\u201d Bocuse told the AP. \u201c(At La Mere Brazier) you had to wake up early and milk the cows, feed the pigs, do the laundry and cook \u2026. It was a very tough school of hard knocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, the profession has changed enormously. There\u2019s no more coal. You push a button and you have heat,\u201d he said.\n\nBocuse adapted seamlessly to the changing times, making his mark with a first coveted Michelin star in 1958, a second in 1960 and a third in 1965. Since then, his cooking has been defined by superlatives.\n\nIn 1989, Bocuse was named Cook of the Century by Gault & Millau, a noted guidebook. In 2011, the Culinary Institute of America named him Chef of the Century, opening a restaurant for students in his name. He maintained a special pride, however, in the blue, white and red stripes on his chef\u2019s collar holding a large medal, attesting to his selection in 1961 as a \u201cMeilleur Ouvrier de France,\u201d a sought-after distinction for chefs and other artisans.\n\nThe gastronomic offerings at Bocuse\u2019s L\u2019Auberge du Pont de Collonges are rooted in the French culinary tradition: simple, authentic food that was \u201cidentifiable\u201d in its nature.\n\nEmblematic of that was a crock of truffle soup topped with a golden bubble of pastry he created in 1975 for then-French President Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing, which is served to this day. Another classic is fricassee of Bresse chicken \u2014 from France\u2019s Bresse region, which is famed for its poultry \u2014 served in cream with morilles, a spring mushroom.\n\nAnd his favorite ingredient? Butter.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s a) magical product,\u201d he said during a visit to the Culinary Institute of America. \u201cNothing replaces butter.\u201d\n\nThree other cooking must-haves, according to the chef, are fresh produce (his was from his own garden), good, trusted kitchen staff and happy diners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the client who runs the house,\u201d Bocuse said in the AP interview.\n\nHe disparaged the notion that his culinary offerings amounted to nouvelle cuisine, although he incorporated aspects of it. And he scoffed at critics who contended that his food is stuck in a bygone age. Georges Auguste Escoffier, who gave classic French cuisine a world profile, remains a solid inspiration at Bocuse\u2019s table.\n\n\u201cEscoffier was the master of us all,\u201d Bocuse has said.\n\nWorld War II interrupted his kitchen duties. He worked in the First Division of the Free French Forces, was wounded and cared for at a U.S. field hospital.\n\n\u201cI always say I have American blood in my veins because \u2026 I had transfusions of American blood,\u201d he told the AP. An American flag still flies outside his restaurant.\n\nThe war had a lasting impact on the chef.\n\n\u201c(It) forges the character,\u201d he said. \u201cYou no longer have the same idea of life.\u201d\n\nBocuse might have settled for being a renowned French chef worthy of a pilgrimage by food lovers with deep pockets. Instead, he parlayed his culinary skills into a conglomerate of food operations that span the globe and range from haute cuisine to fast food.\n\nHe opened two brasseries in Lyon in 1995 and 1997. He added three other eateries in the city and even a hotel. He planted restaurants in the south of France, in Geneva and hopped across the world to Japan, where eight Bocuse brasseries, cafes and other establishments were opened.\n\nBut his pride is transmitting his savoir-faire to a young generation through the Foundation Paul Bocuse, established in Lyon in 2004. His Bocuse d\u2019Or, or gold award \u2014 an international competition for young chefs \u2014 has grown into a major culinary showcase since 1987.\n\nWhile Bocuse\u2019s kitchens were meticulously in order, his personal life was on the unorthodox side. He acknowledged in a 2005 biography that he had been quietly sharing his life with three women \u2014 simultaneously \u2014 each with a pivotal role in his life.\n\n\u201cI think cuisine and sex have lots of common points,\u201d Bocuse said before publication of \u201cPaul Bocuse: The Sacred Fire.\u201d \u201cEven if it seems a bit macho, I love women.\u201d\n\nHe put an upbeat spin on his private life.\n\n\u201cIf I calculate the number of years I\u2019ve been faithful to the three women who count in my life, I get 145 years,\u201d he is quoted as saying in \u201cThe Sacred Fire,\u201d which was written by Eve-Marie Zizza-Lalu \u2014 daughter of the most recent woman in his life, Patricia, whom he met in 1972.\n\nYet it is his wife Raymonde, with whom Bocuse had a daughter, Francoise, who helps watch over his restaurant.\n\nDespite accolades from the world of gastronomy, Bocuse saw a restaurant\u2019s reservation book as the real measure of any chef\u2019s talent.\n\n\u201cIf the restaurant works, if it\u2019s full of clients \u2026 whatever the cuisine, he (the chef) is right,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Raymonde, their daughter Francoise and a son, Jerome.", "title": "Paul Bocuse, Master of French Cuisine, Dies at 91", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5111128/chef-paul-bocuse-dies/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T15:23:23Z"}, {"textData": "A neighbor who allegedly attacked Kentucky Sen.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nUncle Sam is a self-cutter.\n\nBut unlike others who intentionally harm themselves and have our concern, Sam has earned our scorn.\n\nHis Congress disgraced the nation when much of the government shut down at midnight Friday because the partisans on Capitol Hill could not agree to keep it running. This is a gross dereliction of duty for the American people and particularly their employees.\n\nEven Democrats who represent large numbers of the federal workforce put politics above the people. Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine defended their opposition to House Republican legislation that would have kept the government open with their Thursday statement that said the temporary spending measure \u201cignores key priorities \u2014 community health centers, permanent protection for Dreamers, emergency relief for Florida, Texas, western states ravaged by wildfires, Puerto Rico, the USVI, opioid treatment, and pension reform. These issues are not going away and need to be addressed immediately.\u201d\n\nBut partially shutting the government only delays addressing these issues.\n\nShortly after midnight, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blamed Democrats, saying they \u201cchose to filibuster a noncontroversial funding bill that contains nothing \u2014 not a thing \u2014 they do not support.\u201d\n\nAs the debate over whether Republicans or Democrats deserve blame for this debacle boils, Jeff Roberts knows who loses when the government largely shuts. The retired Bureau of Prisons electronic technician is still waiting to be fully compensated from the last partial government shutdown, a shameful 16 days in 2013.\n\nRoberts is one of about 25,000 federal employees and retirees who will benefit \u2014 eventually \u2014 from a U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruling in February. They were paid, but late. Then-Chief Judge Patricia E. Campbell-Smith ordered Uncle Sam to compensate them because they did not receive their pay, including overtime, on time.\n\nBut the court-ordered compensation is late coming.\n\nIt\u2019s now been almost a year since the court\u2019s decision and more than four years since the 2013 shutdown.\n\nYet Heidi R. Burakiewicz is understanding. She represents the employees and cites a laborious bureaucratic process, not government foot-dragging, for the delay in making her clients whole.\n\nOn Tuesday, she and Justice Department lawyers jointly told the court they are working with a consultant who is helping with calculations on the payoff each employee is due. The lawyers expect to submit a joint status report to Campbell-Smith next month. In a joint brief last year, she and government lawyers cited \u201cthe complexity of the endeavor\u201d in determining the amount for each worker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping the government is close to collecting all the records they need to collect,\u201d Burakiewicz, of the employment law firm Kalijarvi, Chuzi, Newman & Fitch, said in an interview. \u201cThe next step is calculating the payments.\u201d\n\nBut, she adds, \u201cthis situation was clearly avoidable.\u201d\n\nFor folks like Roberts, it\u2019s also aggravating. And it\u2019s not just about the money. There is an emotional toll.\n\nRoberts recalls his son asking, \u201c \u2018Are you still going to have a job?\u2019 It isn\u2019t something he should have to worry about.\u201d\n\nThe family cut back on food and clothes for his children. Credit card debt grew.\n\nRoberts said he talked to local bankers in his small Arkansas town, not just for himself, but also on behalf of colleagues who turned to him as an older and wiser head. His bank allowed Roberts to delay truck loan payments without being reported to credit agencies.\n\nOne colleague had to contend with expensive prescription costs after an organ transplant. \u201cThat\u2019s real stuff that people have to deal with,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThese are working people, not six-figure people.\u201d\n\nManaging finances without knowing when your paycheck will come \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s frustrating,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely frustrating.\u201d\n\nFederal employees probably will get back pay after the current shutdown.\n\nBut unlike federal staffers, many contractors did not get back pay after the last shutdown and probably won\u2019t this time.

Saudi Arabia, Iran and South Korea also sent fewer students in 2017.\n\nThe figures were released today in the 2018 Science and Engineering Indicators report from the National Science Foundation\u2019s governing body, the National Science Board.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., (international students) are tremendously important,\u201d said Geraldine Richmond, a member of the National Science Board and chemistry professor at the University of Oregon. \u201cOver 50% of our graduate students in technical areas are from outside the country.\u201d\n\nThe number of U.S.-born students in STEM graduate programs started declining in 2008, and international students have been important in keeping program numbers up, Richmond said.\n\n\u201cWe have a research engine that needs to be fueled, and that fuel is really our graduate students,\u201d Richmond said. \u201cSo, as we continue to try to attract the best and brightest in our country, we also seek to attract the best and brightest from these other countries.\u201d\n\nGraduate programs also feed, in part, into hubs like Silicon Valley, where more than half of tech workers are foreign-born.\n\n\u201cThere is an insatiable demand. There\u2019s more jobs than we can fill with the current slate of talent,\u201d said Michael Morell, a founder of the tech recruiting firm Riveria Partners.\n\n\u201cThe way we talk about it internally is, if you are an average or above-average engineer with core skills as a computer scientist, that is probably a negative unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nThe new National Science Board report doesn\u2019t try to explain why enrollment numbers dropped in 2017.\n\nGeraldine Richmond said it will be important to see if this one-year dip turns into a trend. She points to the relatively high costs of coming to the U.S. for graduate school, as well as increasing competition from China, as possible contributing factors.\n\nA survey last year by the American Association of College Registrar and Admissions Officers raised similar concerns about international students overall.\n\nStudents from India concerned about job prospects, safety\n\nThe concerns of Indian students planning to attend graduate school in the next few years suggest this dip might not be a one-year aberration.\n\nSeveral students interviewed by PRI.org worried that with changing U.S. immigration policies under President Trump's administration, they may not be able to get jobs after graduation, which would saddle them with the debt of an American degree but provide few of the benefits. Some worried about their personal safety as cases of anti-immigrant violence make news around the world. Others were turned off simply by the high cost of pursuing a degree in the US.\n\nMany are looking to Canada, Australia, Germany and the U.K. as possible destinations for graduate school instead of the U.S.\n\nOne of those students is Sai Shouri, a senior studying IT at an engineering college in Hyderabad, India. When he was a kid, relatives who lived in the U.S. would come back to India for visits and tell him about the job opportunities and comfortable lifestyle that came with living in the US.\n\n\u201cSince my childhood, I had dreams of the U.S., studying in the U.S. as well as getting settled in the U.S.,\u201d Shouri said.\n\nFour years ago, he started an undergraduate degree in IT specifically so he\u2019d be competitive for a computer science master\u2019s program in the U.S. But his plans changed in a single moment in the fall of 2016.\n\n\u201cThat moment was when Trump was elected,\u201d Shouri said.\n\nShouri had followed Trump\u2019s America-first campaign platform and his promises to restrict immigration to increase job opportunities for citizens.\n\n\u201cWe used to believe that,\u201d Shouri said. \u201cIf he really gets to be the president of the United States of America, then we might have a tougher situation.\u201d\n\nHe thought landing a job might be harder, and after hearing about anti-immigrant violence in the US, like how two Indian men were shot in a Kansas City bar last February, he feared for his safety.\n\n\u201cWhat if I get attacked by some random guy?\u201d Shouri worried.\n\nIt was enough for Shouri to ditch his decade-old dream to study in the United States.\n\n\u201c(I was) shattered for some time, for a couple of days I was, like, totally aimless.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s immigrant-friendly reputation attractive to students\n\nInternational enrollment trends in Australia and Canada are moving in the opposite direction. International students in Australian colleges and universities were up 15% from March 2016 to March 2017.\n\nCanada also saw increases.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment for Canada to shine,\u201d said Paul Davidson, president of Universities Canada, which represents nearly 100 institutions across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have seen an 11% increase in international enrollment at Canadian universities over the last year,\u201d Davidson said.\n\nHe first started seeing increases of interest in Canadian universities after Brexit. Then came Trump's January 2017 travel ban.\n\n\u201cThe weekend that that happened, my iPhone was absolutely dancing across the table, because the world wants to find an alternative,\u201d Davidson said.\n\nThat Canadian alternative caught Shouri\u2019s eye when researching graduate school options outside the U.S. after Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cI was reading about that country, and I fell in love,\u201d Shouri said.\n\nShouri started chatting online with Canadians and found them welcoming.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t mind which country you\u2019re from, what\u2019s your financial status, how you look, how you talk, they don\u2019t care about any of those things,\u201d Shouri said.\n\nThat rosy view of Canada was reinforced by what Shouri saw on the news.\n\n\u201cYou can see the prime minister (Justin Trudeau), how he\u2019s accepting the Syrian refugees, going to the airport, receiving them one by one, hugging each of them,\u201d Shouri said. \u201cAnd you can see Mr. Trump. And you can see a contrast between them.\u201d\n\nShouri has applied to five computer science programs in Canada and hopes to start at one of them in September.\n\nHe still wants to work at a big tech company like Google \u2014 just in their Canadian office.\n\nAnd he hopes that one day he\u2019ll return home to Hyderabad with stories of how great his new home is. It just probably won\u2019t be in the U.S.\n\nThis article originally appeared on PRI.org.

White House negotiators, legislative affairs director Marc Short and budget chief Mick Mulvaney, went to Capitol Hill to meet with House Republicans, who emerged holding fast to their stance that they would not negotiate while the government was shuttered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a 2-year-old temper tantrum,\u201d Short told reporters at the White House, where there was a growing sense that the shutdown won\u2019t be quickly resolved.\n\nRight around midnight Friday, Senate Democrats killed a GOP-written House-passed measure that would have kept agencies functioning for four weeks. Democrats were seeking a stopgap bill of just a few days in hopes that would build pressure on Republicans, and they were opposing a three-week alternative offered by GOP leaders.\n\nDemocrats have insisted they would back legislation reopening government once there\u2019s a bipartisan agreement to preserve protections against deporting about 700,000 immigrants \u2014 known as \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Each party believes it has a winning political hand, and the day\u2019s first words by party leaders underscored that, so far, neither side believes it is time to give ground.\n\n\u201cThe American people cannot begin to understand why the Senate Democratic leader thinks the entire government should be shut down until he gets his way on illegal immigration,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said voters will fault Trump and the GOP. He blamed Trump for reneging on a near deal that Schumer said the two men had approached during a White House meeting Friday.\n\n\u201cNegotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nAlthough the House and Senate were in session Saturday, it was unclear whether lawmakers would take any votes of consequence.\n\nDemocrats said they oppose the three-week plan, viewing it as a way to stall negotiations over the future of the \u201cDreamers,\u201d whose protections expire in March. Republicans declared they would not reopen talks until the government shutdown ends, a strategy aimed at trying to erode Democratic cohesion.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said Trump had earned an F for \u201cfailure in leadership.\u201d She said Republicans are \u201cso incompetent and negligent that they couldn\u2019t get it together to keep the government open.\u201d\n\nThe fourth government shutdown in a quarter-century began at the stroke of midnight at the start of a weekend, so many of the immediate effects will be muted for most Americans.\n\nSocial Security and most other safety-net programs are unaffected by the lapse in federal spending authority. Critical government functions will continue, with uniformed service members, health inspectors and law enforcement officers set to work without pay. But if no deal is reached before Monday, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed.\n\nArguing that Trump\u2019s predecessors \u201cweaponized\u201d that shutdown, Mulvaney said his budget office would direct agencies to work to mitigate the impact this time, although it was unclear how long that was possible. That position is a striking role reversal for the conservative former congressman who was one of the architects of the 2013 government shutdown.\n\nPolitical damage could grow quickly if the closure is prolonged.\n\nBoth parties are wagering that voters will punish the other at the ballot box in November.\n\nDemocrats are laying fault on Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House and have struggled with building internal consensus. Republicans branded the confrontation a \u201cSchumer shutdown.\u201d The senator assembled enough Democratic opposition to kill the House-passed bill.\n\nTrump said Democrats \u201ccould have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead.\u201d In a series of tweets hours after the shutdown began, the president tried to make the case for Americans to elect more Republicans to Congress in November \u201cin order to power through this mess.\u201d He noted that there are 51 Republicans in the 100-member Senate, and it often takes 60 votes to advance legislation.\n\nThe stopgap measure won 50 votes in the Senate, including five Democrats.\n\nTrump and Schumer tried to cut a last-minute deal that would have included greater military spending and money for a wall along the Mexican border. But the talks fell apart almost as abruptly as they started.\n\nTrump had been set to leave Friday afternoon for a fundraiser at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he intended to mark the inauguration anniversary. But he remained in Washington and ended up scrapping his plans to attend the Saturday fundraiser.\n\nThe last shutdown came in 2013.

(Photo: Laurent Cipriani, AP)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Paul Bocuse, the master chef who defined French cuisine for nearly half a century and put it on tables around the world, a man who raised the profile of top chefs from invisible kitchen artists to international celebrities, has died at 91, French officials announced.\n\nOften referred to as the \"pope of French cuisine,\" Bocuse was a tireless pioneer, the first chef to blend the art of cooking with savvy business tactics \u2014 branding his cuisine and his image to create an empire of restaurants around the globe. His imposing physical stature and his larger-than-life personality matched his bold dreams and his far-flung accomplishments.\n\nBocuse died Saturday at Collonges-au-Mont-d'or, the place where he was born and had his restaurant, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement.\n\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb tweeted that \"Mister Paul was France. Simplicity and generosity. Excellence and art de vivre.\"\n\nBocuse, who underwent a triple heart bypass in 2005, had also been suffering from Parkinson's disease.\n\nBocuse's temple to French gastronomy, L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges, outside the city of Lyon in southeastern France, has held three stars \u2014 without interruption \u2014 since 1965 in the Michelin guide, the bible of gastronomes.\n\nAs early as 1982, Bocuse opened a restaurant in the France Pavilion in Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida, headed by his son Jerome, also a chef. In recent years, Bocuse even dabbled in fast food with two outlets in his home base of Lyon.\n\n\"He has been a leader. He took the cook out of the kitchen,\" said celebrity French chef Alain Ducasse, speaking at a 2013 gathering to honor Bocuse. More than 100 chefs from around the world traveled to Lyon for the occasion \u2014 one of a string of such honors bestowed on Bocuse in recent years.\n\n\"Monsieur Paul,\" as he was known, was placed right in the center of 2013 cover of the newsweekly Le Point that exemplified \"The French Genius.\" Shown in his trademark pose \u2014 arms folded over his crisp white apron, a tall chef's hat, or \"toque,\" atop his head \u2014 he was winged by Marie Curie, Louis Pasteur and Coco Chanel, among other French luminaries.\n\nWhile excelling in the business of cooking, Bocuse never flagged in his devotion to his first love, creating a top class, quintessentially French meal. He eschewed the fads and experiments that captivated many other top chefs.\n\n\"In cooking, there are those who are rap and those who are concerto,\" he told the French newsmagazine L'Express before his 2005 biography, adding that he tended toward the concerto.\n\nIn traditional cooking like his, he said, there is no room for guess work.\n\n\"One must be immutable, unattackable, monumental,\" he declared.\n\nBorn into a family of cooks that he dates to the 1700s, Bocuse stood guard over the kitchen of his world-famous restaurant even in retirement, keeping an eye on guests, sometimes greeting them at table.\n\nThe red-and-green Auberge by the Saone River, his name boldly set atop the roof, is a temple to Bocuse \u2014 who was born there \u2014 and to other great chefs. Bocuse waves to arriving guests in a \"tromp l'oeuil\" painting on an outside wall and peers at them from a large portrait inside the cozy Auberge that once belonged to his parents and remained his home. Renowned chefs, some of whom he worked with, are portrayed in a giant mural.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, Bocuse said he slept in the room where he was born above the dining rooms. \"But I changed the sheets,\" he added with characteristic wry humor.\n\nBorn on Feb. 11, 1926, Bocuse entered his first apprenticeship at 16. He worked at the famed La Mere Brazier in Lyon, then spent eight years with one of his culinary idols, Fernand Point, whose cooking was a precursor to France's nouvelle cuisine movement, with lighter sauces and lightly cooked fresh vegetables.\n\nBocuse's career in the kitchen traversed the ages. He went from apprenticeships and cooking \"brigades,\" as kitchen teams are known, when stoves were coal-fired and chefs also served as scullery maids, to the ultra-modern kitchen of his Auberge.\n\n\"There was rigor,\" Bocuse told the AP. \"(At La Mere Brazier) you had to wake up early and milk the cows, feed the pigs, do the laundry and cook .... It was a very tough school of hard knocks.\"\n\n\"Today, the profession has changed enormously. There's no more coal. You push a button and you have heat,\" he said.\n\nBocuse adapted seamlessly to the changing times, making his mark with a first coveted Michelin star in 1958, a second in 1960 and a third in 1965. Since then, his cooking has been defined by superlatives.\n\nIn 1989, Bocuse was named Cook of the Century by Gault & Millau, a noted guidebook. In 2011, the Culinary Institute of America named him Chef of the Century, opening a restaurant for students in his name. He maintained a special pride, however, in the blue, white and red stripes on his chef's collar holding a large medal, attesting to his selection in 1961 as a \"Meilleur Ouvrier de France,\" a sought-after distinction for chefs and other artisans.\n\nThe gastronomic offerings at Bocuse's L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges are rooted in the French culinary tradition: simple, authentic food that was \"identifiable\" in its nature.\n\nEmblematic of that was a crock of truffle soup topped with a golden bubble of pastry he created in 1975 for then-French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, which is served to this day. Another classic is fricassee of Bresse chicken \u2014 from France's Bresse region, which is famed for its poultry \u2014 served in cream with morilles, a spring mushroom.\n\nAnd his favorite ingredient? Butter.\n\n\"(It's a) magical product,\" he said during a visit to the Culinary Institute of America. \"Nothing replaces butter.\"\n\nThree other cooking must-haves, according to the chef, are fresh produce (his was from his own garden), good, trusted kitchen staff and happy diners.\n\n\"It's the client who runs the house,\" Bocuse said in the AP interview.\n\nHe disparaged the notion that his culinary offerings amounted to nouvelle cuisine, although he incorporated aspects of it. And he scoffed at critics who contended that his food is stuck in a bygone age. Georges Auguste Escoffier, who gave classic French cuisine a world profile, remains a solid inspiration at Bocuse's table.\n\n\"Escoffier was the master of us all,\" Bocuse has said.\n\nWorld War II interrupted his kitchen duties. He worked in the First Division of the Free French Forces, was wounded and cared for at a U.S. field hospital.\n\n\"I always say I have American blood in my veins because ... I had transfusions of American blood,\" he told the AP. An American flag still flies outside his restaurant.\n\nThe war had a lasting impact on the chef.\n\n\"(It) forges the character,\" he said. \"You no longer have the same idea of life.\"\n\nBocuse might have settled for being a renowned French chef worthy of a pilgrimage by food lovers with deep pockets. Instead, he parlayed his culinary skills into a conglomerate of food operations that span the globe and range from haute cuisine to fast food.\n\nHe opened two brasseries in Lyon in 1995 and 1997. He added three other eateries in the city and even a hotel. He planted restaurants in the south of France, in Geneva and hopped across the world to Japan, where eight Bocuse brasseries, cafes and other establishments were opened.\n\nBut his pride is transmitting his savoir-faire to a young generation through the Foundation Paul Bocuse, established in Lyon in 2004. His Bocuse d'Or, or gold award \u2014 an international competition for young chefs \u2014 has grown into a major culinary showcase since 1987.\n\nWhile Bocuse's kitchens were meticulously in order, his personal life was on the unorthodox side.

The location of this new facility will be announced later in the year. USA TODAY\n\nApple put out the kind of press release companies dream of this week.\n\nIt plans to spend $30 billion in the U.S. on new data centers and other facilities, create 20,000 new jobs, build a new corporate campus and spend money on educating the next generation as well.\n\nWhat's not to like, right? The naysayers would point to a few things, including the location where it makes the products that account for most of its profits \u2014 iPhones.\n\nChinese workers in the Foxconn factory in Shenzhen,China on May 27, 2010. Foxconn is considering building a display-manufacturing plant in the U.S., the value of which could exceed $7 billion. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe best-selling consumer device in the United States is designed in Cupertino, Calif. and manufactured primarily 6,500 miles away in Shenzhen, China at the Foxconn facilities. It has no plans to change that.\n\nInstead, Apple's new campus will initially bring on extra tech support folks. That's all well and good, but isn't it time to bring production back here as well? A good part of Donald Trump's successful White House campaign in 2016 was based on promises to bring back manufacturing jobs to America. Love him or hate him, many would agree that we'd rather have products made here than elsewhere. So if we can still make cars and appliances here, why not a smartphone?\n\nBecause the phone would cost as much as double, in the $2,000 range for the iPhone X, says tech analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies. And he cites other reasons as well, notably the cost of skilled labor in China (who are paid around $100 a week, he notes, way less than we offer,) the availability of parts in Asia and the lack of suitable manufacturing facilities here, which would cost Apple millions of dollars to build.\n\n\u201cIt could be done, at a huge cost, not just to Apple, but to you and me as well,\u201d says Bajarin. The bottom line: \u201cWe lost manufacturing to Asia, Southeast Asia, India and Mexico two to three decades ago, and it\u2019s never coming back.\u201d\n\nBeyond Apple, Samsung creates many of its Galaxy phones in South Korea and manufactures them there, as well as Vietnam and India, while Amazon churns out those Echo and Dot speakers in China, and Japan based Nintendo makes the popular Switch video game system in Asia as well.\n\nI know all the reasons for why Apple would choose not to make an iPhone here, but that doesn't stop me from saying, try it. If Apple wanted to shift some production here, open an Apple University to train workers to be as nimble and learned as the Chinese, it could. After all, we're talking about the world's most profitable, and some would argue, innovative company.\n\nThe company could offer a special, more expensive, \"Made in the U.S.A.\" edition of the iPhone (in red, white and blue colors, perhaps) and I'm betting people would buy it. Maybe not with the kinds of numbers seen with the cheaper version, but isn't it worth giving it a try, and perhaps, ahem, thinking differently?\n\nReaders, feel free to weigh in on the comments.

(Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThe government shutdown has the potential to disrupt a lot of things \u2014 government workers' earnings and federal services, for example \u2014 but it's also a precarious situation for your social plans. That's especially true if you have out-of-town visitors coming to the District during the affected time period: Many of the city's best attractions, such as the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, will be open through Monday but could be closed afterward if the shutdown continues. (The Library of Congress and U. S. Botanic Garden are closed.) What will you do with your disappointed nieces and nephews? Where will you take Great Aunt Mary, who traveled all this way?\n\nBut the Washington area is so much more than the Mall. For every shuttered museum or park, we've offered up an apt substitute that is privately-run, thus avoiding the shutdown. They may not be free, like the Smithsonians are, but they offer new and different cultural or historical experiences, especially for seasoned Mall-goers. Or at least they'll get you and your kids out of the house.\n\n[Zoo, Smithsonian will be temporarily open this weekend if government shuts]\n\nAnacostia Community Museum and the National Museum of African American History\n\nAlternatives: Banneker-Douglass Museum or Alexandria Black History Museum\n\nThe Anacostia Community Museum takes a community-focused look at African American history. So does the Banneker-Douglass Museum in Annapolis, which traces the African American experience in Maryland from colonial days through Harriet Tubman and Matthew Henson, and the Alexandria Black History Museum, where exhibitions honor local activists and explore the impact of slavery in the area.\n\nHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden\n\nAlternative: National Museum of Women in the Arts\n\nGet your modern art fix at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, where \u201cMagnetic Fields\u201d examines common threads in multiple generations of abstract art created by African American painters, printers and sculptors, and \u201cHung Liu in Print\u201d rounds up paintings, tapestries and prints by Chinese artist Hung Liu.\n\nLibrary of Congress\n\nAlternative: Folger Shakespeare Library\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t have the same American focus, the Folger Shakespeare Library is another repository for important, historical documents, including 82 of the 235 known copies of Shakespeare's First Folio.\n\nNational Air and Space Museum/Udvar-Hazy Center\n\nAlternative: College Park Aviation Museum\n\nThe College Park Aviation Museum is a great way, even under normal circumstances, to avoid the crowds at the Air and Space Museum. It has crafts for kids, interactive displays, flight simulators, planes to climb on and yes, a goodie bag for the little ones at the end of the visit.\n\n[The Washington region knows how a shutdown feels. And it\u2019s not good.]\n\nNational Gallery of Art\n\nAlternative: Phillips Collection\n\nThe National Gallery may be bigger, but the Phillips Collection is where modern art got its start in the District. The museum was founded in 1921, 20 years before the National Gallery opened its doors. Spend some time with the Phillips's permanent collection in lieu of a trip to the National Gallery of Art's west building, and linger in the Rothko Room as an alternative to the east building.\n\nNational Museum of African Art\n\nAlternative: The African Art Museum of Maryland\n\nMasks, musical instruments, textiles and jewelry can be found in Fulton, where the African Art Museum of Maryland houses a collection of traditional and contemporary African artworks and objects. And the best part, for budget-conscious nonessentials? Admission is free.\n\nNational Museum of American History\n\nAlternative: Mount Vernon\n\nThe Father of Our Country is given his due at Mount Vernon, where interactive movies and displays on \u201cThe Real George Washington\u201d supplement the usual uniforms, artifacts and historic furniture. Besides, the Smithsonian doesn't have a working distillery \u2014 and George Washington's Mount Vernon does. (For those of us whose favorite childhood memories of American History revolved around the train exhibit, the B&O Railroad Museum in Baltimore is the perfect substitute.)\n\nNational Museum of Natural History\n\nAlternative: Maryland Science Center\n\nIf you've got children who go crazy for dinosaurs, take them to the Maryland Science Center's Dinosaur Mysteries exhibit, where pint-size archaeologists can work in \u201cdig pits,\u201d touch dinosaur skulls, and measure bones and footprints. The Science Center also features hands-on science experiments, and an observatory with a telescope.\n\nNational Postal Museum\n\nAlternative: Newseum\n\nTrade one form of communication for another with a trip to the Newseum, where you can contemplate the First Amendment and the state of our news media, which will be endlessly dissecting the shutdown. While you're there, head up to the terrace on the top floor for the best view of the Capitol building, and give it your angriest glare. Unfortunately, the museum is on the pricier side for budget-conscious furloughed workers \u2014 $24.95 plus tax \u2014 even if the ticket does allow you to spend two days there.\n\nNational Zoo\n\nAlternative: National Aquarium in Baltimore\n\nVery few animal exhibits can match seeing the National Zoo's pandas in person \u2014 unless it's coming face-to-face with sharks zipping around the National Aquarium's massive Blacktip Reef exhibition. The giant coral tanks and hundreds of fish will delight visitors of all ages.\n\nRenwick Gallery\n\nAlternative: Textile Museum\n\nThe Renwick has become known for its crafty exhibits, and the Textile Museum's new home at George Washington University is showing \u201cThe Box Project: Uncommon Threads,\u201d which features intricate three-dimensional works created by three dozen textile artists from around the world \u2014 all of which are small enough to fit in a medium-sized box.\n\nThis story was originally published Sept. 30, 2013.

Pence went ahead with his four-day trip to the Middle East, citing national security and diplomatic reasons. (Khaled Desouki/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence and Egyptian leader Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi pledged a united front against Mideast terrorism on Saturday as Pence, the highest-level American official to visit the U.S. ally in nearly a decade, began a trip through the region amid a government shutdown in Washington.\n\nPence told reporters that he raised the issue of two Americans who have been imprisoned for several years in Egypt and that el-Sissi said \u201che would give personal attention\u201d to their cases. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see our people come home. I made that clear to him,\u201d Pence said before flying to Jordan.\n\nPence and el-Sissi held 2\u00bd hours of talks at the presidential palace in Cairo, with acknowledgements of friendship and partnership between the two countries. Through a translator, Pence listened as el-Sissi cited the need to address \u201curgent issues,\u201d including \u201cways to eliminate this disease and cancer that has terrified the whole world.\u201d\n\nPence pointed to President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to forge stronger ties with el-Sissi in his first year in office, \u201cafter a time when our countries seemed to be drifting apart.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said that \u201cwe stand shoulder to shoulder with you and Egypt in fighting against terrorism\u201d and that \u201cour hearts grieve\u201d for the loss of life in recent terrorist attacks against Egyptians.\n\nThe vice president noted the deadly attack against Christians in late December, when a militant opened fire outside a suburban Cairo church, killing at least nine people. He also cited the killing of 311 worshippers inside a mosque in northern Sinai last November.\n\n\u201cWe resolve to continue to stand with Egypt in the battle against terrorism,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPence arrived in Cairo hours after the U.S. Congress and Trump failed to reach agreement on a plan to avert a partial federal closure. Pence went ahead with his four-day trip to the Middle East, citing national security and diplomatic reasons.\n\nPence\u2019s meetings with el-Sissi delved into security cooperation, economic ties and efforts to fight the Islamic State group. The vice president called it a \u201cvery productive\u201d meeting and said he pressed el-Sissi to cut diplomatic ties with North Korea, urged him to respect religious diversity and told him the U.S. was committed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\n\nHis visit to the region came more than a month after Trump announced his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a step that\u2019s enraged Palestinians. El-Sissi identified \u201cthe peace issue\u201d as one of the most important issues in their discussions.\n\n\u201cWe heard President el-Sissi out,\u201d Pence said. \u201cHe said to me about what he said publicly about a disagreement between friends over our decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\u201d\n\nPence said he assured el-Sissi that \u201cwe\u2019re absolutely committed to preserving the status quo with regard to holy sites in Jerusalem, that we have come to no final resolution about boundaries or other issues that will be negotiated. ... I reminded President el-Sissi that President Trump said that if the parties agree, we will support a two-state solution. My perception was that he was encouraged by that message.\u201d\n\nWhen Pence\u2019s motorcade arrived at the palace, journalists traveling with the vice president were initially barred from exiting their bus. After they were taken into the palace, media were not allowed into a photo session with the two leaders. Negotiations between U.S. and Egyptian officials followed, and Pence personally requested to el-Sissi that American media be allowed to cover the event. Members of the media were eventually taken into the meeting and heard the leaders deliver short statements.\n\nPence was meeting Sunday with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II in Amman and visiting with U.S. troops in the region. He was traveling to Israel later Sunday but was not expected to meet with Palestinians officials.\n\nEl-Sissi has built a strategic alliance with Trump and urged the American president to become more involved in the fight against Islamic militancy in the Middle East. Trump has praised el-Sissi for the April release of Egyptian-American charity worker Aya Hijazi, who had been detained for nearly three years.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s designation of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital poses a dilemma for Egypt, which receives extensive military and economic aid from Washington but does not want to appear dismissive of Palestinian concerns.\n\nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has condemned Trump over the Jerusalem announcement and warned that the U.S. can no longer play any role in future peace negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis.\n\nEl-Sissi has tried to reassure Abbas of his continued efforts to secure an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nPence had initially planned to visit the region in December, shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement, but the trip was postponed after Abbas\u2019 refusal to meet the vice president in Bethlehem.\n\n___\n\nOn Twitter follow Ken Thomas at @KThomasDC.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jessica Kourkounis for The Washington Post)\n\nAmazon promises its second headquarters will add as many as 50,000 jobs. That\u2019s a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s bigger than Donald Trump\u2019s 44,292-vote margin in Pennsylvania, a state that has two cities (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) in the final 20 contenders.\n\nIn a few other swing states, it\u2019s close.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat raises a whale of a question: Could Amazon\u2019s decision about where to place its headquarters transform the electoral landscape in 2024 and beyond?\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely, but in certain scenarios, conceivable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new headquarters from Amazon (whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post) would pack enough of an employment and economic punch that it could have a measurable effect on presidential elections. To estimate that effect, we need to understand who Amazon\u2019s workers will be, and how they\u2019ll vote.\n\nThe company's solicitation for bids indicates that the retailer is looking for a workforce that is \u201chighly educated\u201d in software development and other disciplines and steadily renewed by a \u201cstrong university system\u201d and outside workers drawn to the area. These and other requirements strongly indicate that the company is looking to attract recent college graduates and other young, educated workers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s HQ2 promotional materials focus on hiring local workers (as you might expect from a colossal corporation trying to win incentives from host cities), but their requirements also emphasize a city\u2019s \u201cability to recruit talent to the area.\u201d\n\nWhich one predominates in practice? We can\u2019t venture a guess, but the answer would significantly affect the political impact of Amazon\u2019s decision. Outside workers are presumably more likely to change a city\u2019s political mix than residents, but the arrival of a major new employer would help a city retain the sorts of workers that, in a previous era, might have moved away.\n\nThe group Amazon seems to regard as its hiring pool, college graduates younger than 40, leans heavily Democratic. In the 2016 election, the national network exit poll found 56 percent of them voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton vs. 35 percent for Trump.\n\nBut will there be enough of them working at Amazon's new headquarters to swing any states? Let\u2019s try running some numbers.\n\nIt\u2019s easy enough to count the workers. Amazon says it will hire as many as 50,000 people at its new hub over the next 10 to 15 years, as well as create \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of additional jobs through direct investment. In Seattle, it pegs that additional-job number at 53,000. We\u2019ll use that figure in our back-of-the-envelope math,to obtain a high-side estimate.\n\nThat starts us out at 103,000 theoretical Amazon and Amazon-adjacent workers.\n\nTo estimate how many voting family members those workers might bring along, we can use a 2015 Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data that finds a marriage rate of about 65 percent for adults age 25 or older.\n\nThat brings us up to 169,950 workers and spouses. Caveat: We have no idea how many Amazonians married each other. The government doesn\u2019t release that info.\n\nNot all of those are eligible voters. Some may be felons, while many more won\u2019t hold citizenship in the United States. For our estimate, then, we\u2019ll count only 92 percent of the total \u2014 roughly the percentage of adult U.S. residents who, according to the Census Bureau, held citizenship in 2015. That drops it to 155,844.\n\nAnd not all those who are eligible to vote go to the polls. According to the census, voter turnout was 64.1 percent for bachelor\u2019s degree holders ages 25 to 44 in 2016. That drops our number to about 99,896.\n\nBased on our assumptions, the Democrats would capture about 55,942 of those voters and Republicans would get 34,964, making for a total Democratic margin of 20,974.\n\nThat\u2019s more than Trump\u2019s 10,704 margin in Michigan and close to his 22,748 margin in Wisconsin, but it\u2019s not big enough to flip any of the states on the Amazon shortlist.\n\nOurs is already a high-end estimate of Amazon\u2019s impact \u2014 it accounts for both Amazon\u2019s hiring and the jobs it claims to directly create, and assumes that all such jobs will be new to the region. A more conservative set of assumptions would result in a margin of less than half that size. But neither model captures everything.\n\nSpecifically, the cities clamoring for the online retail giant\u2019s attention are counting on a salubrious knock-on effect. They hope that Amazon\u2019s economic activity and stamp of approval will draw in other tech companies and help their city become the next Seattle or San Jose.\n\nIf that happens, all of the political effects here will be multiplied, perhaps to the point where the state hosting the chosen city will tip from one party to the other \u2014 unless Toronto wins, in which case all our assumptions are bunk because it's in Canada.\n\nThese cities are begging to have their economies transformed by Amazon, but not all of them, particularly those in red and purple states, may realize that it could transform them politically as well. After all, U.S. tech hubs end up following a similar political pattern.\n\nEven if the city\u2019s presidential pick doesn\u2019t change, their new Amazonian voting bloc is likely to upend local and congressional elections.\n\nScott Clement contributed to this report.", "title": "Could Amazon\u2019s new headquarters flip the presidential vote in a swing state?", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/01/21/could-amazons-hq-choice-flip-the-presidential-vote-in-a-swing-state/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T14:10:18Z"}, {"textData": "the look Where the Real Los Angeles Meets the Dream On Sunset Boulevard, two Californias \u2014 the lived place and the one seen on screen \u2014 run parallel for 22 snaking miles.\n\nImage Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles is both a real street and a myth.

Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times\n\nMoving west into Beverly Hills and Bel-Air, the street becomes wide and lush and curving. The sidewalks and pedestrians disappear, and the wealthy residents in their mansions hide from the celebrity-home bus tours behind walls of hedgerow \u2014 the Sunset of \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d and \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nWhen you see the line of tall palm trees arcing over the pink facade of the Beverly Hills Hotel (9641 Sunset), the whole thing becomes undeniable: Sunset Boulevard is a visual clich\u00e9 of itself.\n\nIs that so bad? Not at all. It can even be strange and wonderful and moving, as shown through these photographs by Jake Michaels, who drove the length of Sunset with his camera. He wanted to capture the \u201cmicrocultures\u201d the boulevard passes through on its journey to the beach. But in documenting daily life there, Mr. Michaels inevitably captured the myth, too.\n\nImage The Body Shop, a strip club on Sunset. Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times\n\nShooting from inside his car, on a bright day, he found a guy in black leather astride a motorcycle, waiting for a light to change near the Hollywood Palladium (6215 Sunset). \u201cThe Palladium in the background, the motorcycle, the palm trees, the blue sky \u2014 it\u2019s almost like the establishing shot in a movie,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.\n\nDeeper into West Hollywood, he encountered two rocker guys in a black Corvette Stingray, looking like they\u2019d just left band rehearsal for Faster Pussycat. For some, it will forever be 1986 on the Sunset Strip. There\u2019s an odd timelessness to the image \u2014 an evocation of the real-life present and an eternal music video of the mind.\n\nImage Soaking up the sun on Sunset and Coronado Street.

He looks laid-back cool behind the wheel in sunglasses and a Curtis Mayfield leather cap. But with its sun streaks, soft focus and off-kilter framing, the photo has a fleeting, ethereal quality. Like a ghost image of the east side 30 years earlier, before the waves of gentrification, or the present moment glimpsed in its impermanence.\n\nImage Outside the Palladium Theater on Sunset and El Centro. Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times\n\nThere is expressive fashion in these images, as you\u2019d expect to find on a street that beckons people to express themselves. A bald slim man with head tattoos poses in vibrantly distressed flare-leg jeans; a man and woman talk on the sidewalk, the woman dressed in a cherry red suit; a white-haired old hippie named Chuck shows off his sleeveless denim jacket, with its decades of sewn-on rock \u2019n\u2019 roll patches.\n\nMr. Michaels met Chuck in a parking lot at the end of Sunset, down by the beach. He told the photographer he\u2019d just come from the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine (17190 Sunset), the curious, white-domed, temple-like building in Pacific Palisades, itself an icon and visual stereotype for West Coast spiritual seeking.\n\nImage On Sunset and Orange Drive.

Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times\n\nMr. Michaels\u2019s most self-reflective image in his estimation was one he took outside Amoeba Music (6400 Sunset), back in Hollywood. He spotted a teenage couple there one night and began talking to them. It was the couple\u2019s anniversary, they told him. They\u2019d come to buy records, and couldn\u2019t wait to go home and listen to music together.\n\nPhotographed walking and holding hands, the boy wears a kind of military jacket and a wisp of mustache, the girl a vintage fur coat and waves of long brown curls. Like the rockers, they are present-day figures from another decade. It could be 1974, or 2018. As Mr. Michaels put it: \u201cThe future goes on, but the past stays present.\u201d\n\nIt brought him back to his own teenage years hanging out on the Sunset Strip in the early 2000s, and confirmed how some places enliven and elevate otherwise typical moments.\n\nA couple of regular teenagers out together becomes an iconic portrait of young love. Why? Because it\u2019s on Sunset Boulevard.\n\nImage A stretch limousine drives down Sunset toward the strip.

Maybe request an appearance down the line, if day one doesn't work out?\n\nNeil Cavuto, launching another program on Fox News on Saturday, didn't bother asking for President Trump \u2014 and doesn't plan to. He said on the air in November that he doesn't think interviewing Trump would be worthwhile.\n\nHe told me he still feels that way, as he prepared to host the first episode of \u201cCavuto Live,\u201d a two-hour show that will air on Saturdays at 10 a.m. Cavuto is now on the air 17 hours per week on Fox News and Fox Business.\n\nWe spoke on Friday afternoon about Trump, the looming prospect of a government shutdown, breaking news on weekends, and how he does live TV without a teleprompter. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nTHE FIX: We don't have a shutdown watch every week, but the president does tend to make news on the weekends. Was that part of the thinking behind another live show?\n\nCAVUTO: I think it was. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. I mean, the fact of the matter is that so much news is made on the weekend and so much is dumped on the Friday before that you can't really risk not being live. One of the things I've seen over the course of my time at Fox News, from its inception, [is] we've effectively doubled our live time and dramatically increased our live time on the business network. The times really demand it. We found that Saturday morning, between 10 a.m. and noon, is a far busier and more robust time than even I figured when I started doing these business shows on tape on the weekends.\n\nTHE FIX: How the heck are you preparing for the first show? Do you have two different rundowns, one if the government shuts down and one if there's a deal?\n\nCAVUTO: Well, you know, the issue \u2014 and I don't hide this from people \u2014 is because of my MS [multiple sclerosis], I can't read a prompter. It's been years. So, everything is always fly by the seat of the pants for me, anyway. . . . I wish I could say that was all genius planning, rather than something that's physically required of me.\n\nTHE FIX: I've read that about you. You don't use a prompter at all?\n\nCAVUTO: No. I wish I could. A lot of times it would come in handy, like for pronouncing guests' names. Seriously, though, when my MS began accelerating, and I lost the ability to focus on words and images, you just adapt.\n\nTHE FIX: You said on one of your other shows that interviewing President Trump wouldn't be a good use of time. Do you still feel that way?\n\nCAVUTO: You know, I really don't have any hankering to [interview him]. And I like him; he's not a bad person. I've interviewed him many times and known him for over 30 years as a businessman and covered him in business venues, whether when I was at PBS or CNBC or Fox. I just strongly believe that . . . you have a limited amount of time with a president, and I would spend a good deal of time trying to clarify \u2014 or have him try to clarify \u2014 statements that I believe to be demonstrably false. And I thought that would eat up a lot of our time and before you know it, they'd say, \u201cThat's it. Interview's over.\u201d I don't think anyone in the West Wing is shedding tears over my position. I just feel that better people than I would, and should, do it. I just have zero interest in doing it.\n\nTHE FIX: What about other administration officials? How do you see the value of interviewing them, when it seems like the only official word on the president's position comes from him? We just saw John Kelly on Bret Baier's show, and the next morning, Trump was on Twitter, undermining what his own chief of staff just said. On one hand, you might say that's a waste of time because these officials don't have the authority to speak for Trump; on the other, you might say it's revealing if they are not in step.\n\nCAVUTO: Well, I think in that case, you might have supported the argument to interview these officials, especially when they say something that generates a reaction like Kelly's interview with Bret. The president was obviously pissed off. I don't want it to sound like there's an edict: \u201cWe're not going to try for anyone in the White House.\u201d . . . I just want to make sure I do my research, find out where their comments jibe with prior comments they've made or the president has made. I've almost always discovered that there is a nuance or a wrinkle to what they're saying, from what they've previously said or what the president has said. That wouldn't be unique to this administration. I noticed it talking to Obama officials. But this administration has it on steroids.\n\nCorrection: This post originally misstated the channel airing \u201cCavuto Live.\u201d It is Fox News, not Fox Business.", "title": "Why Fox News\u2019s Neil Cavuto still doesn\u2019t want to interview Trump", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/20/why-fox-newss-neil-cavuto-still-doesnt-want-to-interview-trump/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T14:00:21Z"}, {"textData": "There's more to Chris Hemsworth than Thor.

However, the first two Thor standalone films (Thor and Thor: The Dark World) are a bit bland, and the best (Thor: Ragnarok) isn't available to stream yet. But Hemsworth does good work in the first Avengers film, where he suits up with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. and you see some of his comedic chops come out for the first time.\n\nRent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube.\n\nIf you loved how funny he was in Thor: Ragnarok: Ghostbusters (2016)\n\nChris Hemsworth in 'Ghostbusters.'

We're partial to his scene-stealing turn in the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot, where his doltish receptionist hampered all the ghostbusting that needed to be done, rather than helping it.\n\nStream it on Starz.\n\nIf you like horror films: The Cabin in the Woods\n\nMarty (Fran Kranz, left), Curt (Chris Hemsworth,) and Jules (Anna Hutchison) in a scene from the motion picture \"Cabin in the Woods.\" (Photo: Diyah Pera, Lionsgate)\n\nHemsworth gave the horror genre a try in this film penned by Avengers director Joss Whedon. Cabin puts a twist on the horror genre when five college kids head to a cabin for a fun weekend away.

That was as many as in all of 2016, the American Association of Poison Control Centers said. Last year, poison control centers handled 53 such cases, the group said in a news release.\n\nThe problem is more serious for young children. Last year, centers received 10,570 reports of children 5 or younger being exposed to the packets, the group said. Details on the severity of the injuries were unavailable.\n\nThe health risks have been around nearly as long as the detergent packets themselves. Tide, for example, began selling its pods in February 2012, according to the company. About a year later, federal consumer safety officials were compelled to warn families that children find such packets appealing.\n\nWhy are they so dangerous?\n\nThe companies that make the packets use different formulas, but one thing is clear: They contain more than just soap, said Dr. Diane Calello, the medical director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.\n\nHighly concentrated detergent and a variety of chemicals are inside, depending on the brand, she said. Tide pods contain 90 percent active ingredients and 10 percent water, according to the company. A dissolvable covering holds it all in.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is when children or adults bite into these things that moisture-sensitive membranes basically just disintegrates and the contents explode inside your mouth,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pain sets in. The chemicals cause severe burns to the mouth, esophagus or respiratory tract, she said, adding that some very young and very old patients with cognitive issues have been rushed to emergency rooms or even died as a result of eating the packets.\n\n\u201cThis is not something I would put anywhere near someone\u2019s mouth,\u201d she said.\n\nHow did this even start?\n\nThe origins and inspiration of the challenge are murky, but jokes have circulated online about the temptation of a product that is known to be dangerous but that bears a resemblance to brightly colored candy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn late 2015, the satirical publication The Onion published commentary from a child\u2019s perspective in which he vowed to consume one.\n\n\u201cFrom the very second I saw those blue and red detergent pods come out of that shopping bag last week, I knew immediately that, come hell or high water, I would eat one of those things,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLast March, the comedy website CollegeHumor posted a video sketch in which a man agonized over his desire to eat the pods, which he compared to Gushers, the fruit snacks with a liquid center and chewy outer covering.\n\nIn recent weeks, similar jokes have surfaced online featuring real or doctored images of the pods made to look like food, such as pizza toppings.\n\nEven a senator, Chuck Schumer of New York, once said he was tempted to eat a pod because of its bright colors. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they make them look so delicious,\u201d he said at a 2012 news conference about their medical risks, according to The Daily News.\n\nWhat should you do if someone ingests a laundry pod?\n\nIf you or someone is exposed to detergent, it\u2019s important to reach a medical expert right away, either by contacting a poison control center or a doctor.\n\nThe American Association of Poison Control Centers also maintains a hotline, 1-800-222-1222, where experts are always available to field questions.

That\u2019s what this is about,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about women or fascism or whatever else you want to blow this into. This is about equality.\u201d\n\nIn Leonia, N.J., rallygoers included Kristy Bortnik, who became a citizen shortly before the 2016 election and was able to vote then for the first time. She felt \u201cdevastated\u201d at that time.\n\n\u201cI spent many years not having a voice, so to see all the craziness and just sit back and not do anything didn\u2019t seem right,\u201d Bortnik said.\n\nStacy Wallace of Washington marches in front of the White House during the Women's March on Washington.

They argued Trump represents old ways of thinking that largely benefit white men and large corporations, instead of building an inclusive society where everyone is welcome.\n\n\u201cLast year, I was angry,\u201d said Denver marcher Anya Chavez, 14, who came with her younger sister and parents. \u201cToday I\u2019m feeling empowered, feeling really good. I feel good because I\u2019m making a difference.\u201d\n\nIn Los Angeles the march drew celebrities and ordinary people alike.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I have a wife, I have a beautiful daughter. And I just believe 100% we need to do better for women,\u201d said Dan Griffin, 45, a consultant from Culver City who attended with both his wife and daughter. \u201cIf we do better for women, we do better for men.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, marchers were overwhelmingly white, although organizers said they made stronger efforts this year to connect with communities of color and pushed to register voters.\n\n\"White women need to talk to other white women,\" said Norma Balentine of Milwaukee, an African-American voting rights advocate participated because of the emphasis on voter registration. \"They need to talk to them about why they vote against their own interests, why they vote for people like Trump and Moore. It's disturbing,\" she said.\n\nBeautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2018\n\nSeveral white women said they want to be stronger allies who will lift the voices and experiences of women of color. Molly Grupe of Monona, Wis., and Sarah Bayrd of Minneapolis were two of them. The sisters stood, arms around each other, surveying the sea of pink and posters below in Milwaukee\n\n\"It's all women or no women,\" said Bayrd.\n\nHer sister Grupe is a Monona city council candidate who wants to see that change.\n\n\"A lot of women felt left out by the women's march last year,\" said Grupe. \"We don't thrive without women of color.\"\n\nContributing: Doug Stanglin in McLean, Va.; Donna Leinwand in Zurich; Alia Dastagir in New York; Andrea Mandell in Los Angeles; Annysa Johnson of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nMore: Is the Women's March more inclusive this year?\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2DseSmL", "title": "Activists take to the streets, voting booth to mark anniversary of women's march", "sourceId": "usa-today", "sourceName": "USA Today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/01/20/female-activists-mark-annivesary-march-return-return-streets-mark-anniversary-washingotgn-march-retu/1050668001/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T13:31:17Z"}, {"textData": "Warning: This post contains major spoilers for and violent content from all five seasons of Breaking Bad.\n\nIt\u2019s officially been ten years since Bryan Cranston first graced our television screens as down-and-out chemistry teacher Walter White in Breaking Bad. But his metamorphosis into meth kingpin Heisenberg over five epic seasons still hasn\u2019t left our minds.\n\nThe unforgettable AMC drama premiered on Jan. 20, 2008, introducing viewers to showrunner Vince Gilligan\u2019s take on the American Southwest\u2019s drug underworld. It wasn\u2019t long before the series was one of the most popular shows on television and had earned a massive cult following to match. Fans eagerly tuned in each week to see what dark road Walt would go down next, with the show\u2019s mind-bending twists keeping viewers constantly on their toes.\n\nSo in honor of one of the most legendary TV characters of all time, here are the 10 biggest turning points in Walter White\u2019s Breaking Bad transformation.\n\n1. The killing of Krazy-8\n\nSeason 1, Episode 3: \u201c\u2026and the Bag\u2019s in the River\u201d\n\nFaced with the choice of killing Krazy-8 or risking everything by releasing him from his makeshift prison in Jesse\u2019s basement, Walt spends the majority of Breaking Bad\u2018s third episode attempting to convince himself he can safely let the rival dealer go. But after realizing Krazy-8 has no intention of letting bygones be bygones, Walt violently strangles him to death with a bike lock, giving viewers an early taste of his capacity for brutality.\n\n2. An offer refused\n\nSeason 1, Episode 5: \u201cGray Matter\u201d\n\nWhile attending the birthday party of his former business partner Elliott Schwartz, Walt is given an easy out for financing his lung cancer treatment: a job at Elliott\u2019s now billion-dollar company, Gray Matter Technologies. But Walt, who we later find out sold his share in Gray Matter for just $5,000, is way too prideful to accept the offer. Even when Elliott\u2019s wife Gretchen \u2014 who also happens to be Walt\u2019s ex-girlfriend \u2014 calls to practically beg him to take their money, Walt refuses to give in. The episode ends with Walt showing up outside Jesse\u2019s home to ask one simple question: \u201cWant to cook?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did what you\u2019re never supposed to do and employed a deus ex machina in the guise of these two wealthy friends,\u201d Gilligan said of the episode at the 2013 opening of the Museum of the Moving Image\u2019s Breaking Bad exhibit. \u201cThey offer [Walter] everything he needs. At the end of that hour he says, \u2018Thank you, no,\u2019 and he goes back to Jesse Pinkman and says, \u2018Let\u2019s cook.\u2019 And that was where the character truly got interesting for me. This guy\u2019s got some serious pride issues.\u201d\n\n3. Jane\u2019s death\n\nSeason 2, Episode 12: \u201cPhoenix\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s inaction rather than action that defines the scene that many view as the exact moment Walter White truly broke bad. Intent on convincing Jesse to get clean, Walt shows up unannounced at his apartment only to find both him and his girlfriend Jane passed out in a heroin-fueled stupor. Walt shakes Jesse to try to wake him, inadvertenly causing Jane to roll over onto her back. It\u2019s then that she begins to gag and choke on her own vomit. Walt rushes over to help her but hesitates and pulls back, clearly seeing an opportunity to get rid of the threat she presents.\n\nTo put it in Walt\u2019s own words: \u201cI watched Jane die. I was there. And I watched her die. I watched her overdose and choke to death. I could have saved her. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t get much darker than that.\n\n4. \u201cNo more half measures\u201d\n\nSeason 3, Episode 12: \u201cHalf Measures\u201d\n\nAfter Mike attempts to convince Walter to do whatever\u2019s necessary to deal with Jesse\u2019s insistence on taking out the dealers who murdered Combo, Walt is torn between remaining loyal to his partner and staying on the good side of his new boss, Gus Fring. Of course, the growing presence of Heisenberg within him ultimately wins out. Refusing to toe Gus\u2019s line, Walt swoops in at the last-second to rescue Jesse by gruesomely running over the rival dealers with his trusty old Pontiac Aztek. This decision, in turn, gives Walt all the leverage he needs to order Jesse to kill Gale in the season finale.\n\n5. \u201cI am the one who knocks\u201d\n\nSeason 4, Episode 6: \u201cCornered\u201d\n\nIn what is likely the most quoted scene of the entire series, Walt informs Skyler that while she may think he is in danger in the wake of Gale\u2019s murder, it\u2019s actually him who is the danger. \u201cA guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me?\u201d he snaps at her. \u201cNo. I am the one who knocks!\u201d\n\n6. Face off\n\nSeason 4, Episode 13: \u201cFace Off\u201d\n\nThe season four finale gave many fans all the evidence they needed that Walt had completely lost his moral compass. Willing to do anything to get rid of Gus, he entreats the wheelchair-bound Hector Salamanca into setting off a bomb in a retirement home to outsmart the Los Pollos Hermanos kingpin. Of course, that\u2019s only after his plan to blow up Gus\u2019s car in a hospital parking garage doesn\u2019t pan out.\n\nBut while taking out a rival dealer who threatened to kill his entire family may not top the list of Walt\u2019s evils, it\u2019s the final sequence of the episode that reveals his coup de gr\u00e2ce. As Walt drives away from the scene of the crime, the sequence cuts to his backyard before zooming in on a potted plant labeled Lily of the Valley. It then becomes clear that Walt was the one who poisoned Brock \u2014 the young son of Jesse\u2019s girlfriend Andrea \u2014 in an effort to turn Jesse against Gus and bring him back to his corner.\n\n7. \u201cSay my name\u201d\n\nSeason 5, Episode 7: \u201cSay My Name\u201d\n\nIn need of a fresh meth distribution channel after Mike decides to retire, Walt uses his newfound status as the most feared drug kingpin in the Southwest to force Declan and crew to agree to his every demand. By this time, Walt doesn\u2019t even question that his reputation as Heisenberg precedes him. And he\u2019s right not to.\n\n8. The prison killings\n\nSeason 5, Episode 8: \u201cGliding Over All\u201d\n\nFollowing Mike\u2019s murder and the arrest of Dan Wachsberger\u2014 the lawyer tasked with paying off the families of Mike\u2019s nine imprisoned henchmen \u2014 Walt is faced with figuring out how to ensure no one rats him out to the DEA. So what does he do? Enlists white supremacist Jack Welker to arrange for his incarcerated gang members to take out 10 men in three different prisons in the span of two minutes. Breaking Bad fans will never hear Nat King Cole\u2019s \u201cPick Yourself Up\u201d the same way again.\n\n9. \u201cTread lightly\u201d\n\nSeason 5, Episode 9: \u201cBlood Money\u201d\n\nWhen Hank realizes the truth about Walt that has been in front of him all along, it seems like the jig may finally be up. But after all he\u2019s been through, Walt, unsurprisingly, is unwilling to go down without a fight. Instead of giving in when Hank commands that he bring Skyler and the kids over to his house for safety, Walt sends a chilling warning to his brother-in-law.\n\n10. The final confession\n\nSeason 5, Episode 16: \u201cFelina\u201d\n\nAfter insisting for five full seasons that everything he did, he did for his family, Walt finally confesses that all of his actions were entirely self-motivated. Knowing he\u2019s close to death one way or the other, he is at last able to admit that Heisenberg \u2014 rather than Walter White \u2014 is his true persona. \u201cI did it for me,\u201d he tells Skyler. \u201cI liked it. I was good at it. And I was really alive.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Say My Name\u2019: The 10 Biggest Turning Points in Walter White\u2019s Breaking Bad Transformation", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5094038/breaking-bad-walter-white-transformation/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T13:30:34Z"}, {"textData": "ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen announced on Sunday its first budget since the country descended into armed conflict in 2014, in a sign the Saudi-backed government seeks to get a handle on a chaotic economy as millions face starvation.\n\nYemen has been divided by nearly three years of civil war between the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by northern neighbor Saudi Arabia, and the Iran-aligned Houthis.\n\nBased in the port city of Aden, Hadi\u2019s government controls the Central Bank there but has struggled to enforce order in the southern and eastern parts of Yemen that it controls or eject the Houthis from lands they run around the capital Sanaa.\n\nThe conflict has unleashed what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, including one of the most deadly cholera epidemics in modern times and economic collapse, which has spread hunger.\n\nPrime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr told reporters the new budget set total expected revenues in 2018 at 978 billion rials ($2.22 billion) while spending would amount to 1.46 trillion rials ($3.32 billion).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an austerity budget.

In the fall of 2016, most in the cloistered world of international diplomacy thought the U.N. was about to choose its first woman as secretary general, weeks ahead of the United States electing its first woman president. But in the end, it was the 68-year old former prime minister of Portugal who got the job, elected in October 2016 with the support from long-time UN hands who\u2019d marveled quietly at his seemingly casual mastery of languages and policy. A month later, Americans picked Donald Trump, a novice politician who talked about blowing up international institutions like the U.N., instead of Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state with a deep commitment to the existing global order.\nAlmost immediately, Guterres declared his intention to shake things up. An advocate of nimbleness in all things, Guterres told me in Geneva in 2017 that the U.N.\u2019s internal regulations are designed as if \u201cthey had been conceived to paralyze the U.N.\u201d He vowed to reform the U.N.\u2019s development program to make it more economically viable. He wanted to help member states follow through on the Paris climate accord, as well as develop new sustainability goals. And, prompted by dispiriting reports of by U.N. troops in Democratic Republic of Congo sexually assaulting women young women, he saw an urgent need to counter the negative reputation the U.N.\u2019s peace-keepers have developed in certain parts of the world.\nStory Continued Below\nBut less than a month later, before Guterres had even moved into his new offices in Turtle Bay, along came Trump\u2014and suddenly, the U.N.\u2019s new boss wasn\u2019t just tinkering around the edges of a flawed institution; his mission was now to preserve the viability of the 72-year-old institution itself. In Trump, Guterres had to contend with an American president who was openly hostile to the U.N.\u2019s mission (\u201cThe United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it\u2019s not a friend of freedom,\u201d he had said in 2016), who had campaigned on pulling the United States out of all manner of foreign treaties\u2014trade, military and environmental\u2014and who had mocked the U.N. as \u201ca club for people to get together, talk and have a good time\u201d and vowed to slash its budget. Then, as if to drive home how little he thought of the diplomatic class, he nominated then-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as the ambassador to the United Nations, replacing Samantha Power. Unlike Power, who had won the Pultizer Prize for her writing on humanitarian crises and authored the U.S.\u2019s policy on genocide prevention, Haley arrived in New York with no foreign policy experience.\nTrump would, over the course of the next year, trigger a series of international dustups, seemingly reckless provocations\u2014from the puerile taunting of North Korea\u2019s nuke-craving dictator to his abrupt withdrawal from the Paris agreement in August to the widely decried decision in December to officially acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, over the objections of the overwhelming majority of U.N. member states. Last week, in the middle of negotiations over immigration reform, Trump reportedly disparaged the entire continent of Africa as \u201cshithole countries,\u201d prompting outrage in the halls of U.N. headquarters in New York. \u201cThere is no other word you can use but \u2018racist,\u2019\u201d said Rupert Coleville, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nBut for all the obvious points of friction between two men whose dispositions and personalities could not be further apart\u2014Guterres, a fierce advocate for international refugees who is fluent in four languages and likes to quote German philosophers, and Trump, the border-wall promoting nationalist who spends hours a day watching cable news and has sought to ban refugees from Muslim countries\u2014close observers of the U.N. say Guterres\u2019 signature accomplishment over the past year may well have been his pacification of the globalist-baiting provocateur in the Oval Office.\n\u201cIf Guterres had one over-arching success in 2017, it\u2019s been managing the Americans,\u201d says Richard Gowan, an adjunct professor at Columbia University and an expert on the U.N. \u201cHe\u2019s managed to establish some sort of functional relationship with the Trump administration, which is not something we could have predicted or felt confident of at the beginning of the year.\u201d A senior U.N. official who asked to remain anonymous agrees: \u201cIt was a major achievement on the part of Guterres to avoid a showdown with the Americans.\u201d\nGuterres has managed to blunt Trump\u2019s institution-busting instincts by harnessing them them to his own ambitions for reform. Guterres, observers say, sold Trump and Haley on the idea of a leaner, more efficient U.N., a management goal that appealed to Trump\u2019s lifelong dislike for layers of bureaucracy. As for Haley, she and Guterres have managed to find enough common ground to avoid a complete implosion, and that was largely based on the reform package Guterres proposed. His strategy\u2014to propel the U.N. out of its grey, 1970s management style, while quietly wooing Trump\u2014paid off.\nTo prove the point, America\u2019s volatile president has taken a more favorable view of the U.N. since Guterres visited the White House in October. The U.N., Trump said afterward, has the \u201cpower to bring people together, like nothing else.\u201d\n***\nUnlike the way the job is portrayed in, say, Hollywood movies, the U.N. secretary general actually has little formal authority\u2014his or her power lies largely in the ability to persuade and cajole member states. In 2005, Kofi Annan had a breach with the George W. Bush administration when he dared criticize the Iraq invasion during a BBC interview. Annan continued to decry the invasion as illegal, straining his relationship with Bush until Annan\u2019s departure in 2006. But in Trump, Guterres has found a partner with far less sympathy for or experience with international engagement than any preceding president. Indeed, Guterres\u2019 career, with its roots in European socialism, reads like the inverse of Trump\u2019s relentless pursuit of capitalist aggrandizement.\nGrowing up in Lisbon, he saw the intense rural poverty caused by the Estado Novo\u2014the autocratic regime that ruled from the 1920s through the mid-1970s. Guterres\u2019 father imparted to his family \u201ca clear feeling the regime was not legitimate,\u201d he told me. As a young man, Guterres worked at a progressive Catholic organization, doing social work in the slums of Lisbon. He came to a realization, he told me: \u201cThere was no humanitarian solution for the plight of the people living in those slums; the solution would be political and simultaneously linked to a democratic process.\u201d\nGuterres says he became \u201cexpert at organizing spontaneous demonstrations,\u201d noting that this was before the era of Facebook or Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019d say, let\u2019s all go to the Presidential Palace! Or to the parliament or whatever, and we managed to gather anywhere from 20 to 3,000 people.\u201d It was a time, he said, when you could \u201cfeel the strength of the city.\u201d Devoutly Catholic and Socialist at the same time, Guterres ascended to the top of his party not by hewing to the extreme left but rather by engaging with intellectuals, scientists and business leaders across civil society.\nIn 1995, aged 40, Guterres became Portugal\u2019s prime minister, with a campaign slogan of \u201chearts and reason\u201d that outlined his blend of humanism and pragmatism. Three years later, Guterres lost his first wife, a successful psychiatrist, with whom he had two children. Prior to her death from cancer, colleagues remember how he flew back and forth from Lisbon to London, where she was undergoing grueling treatment, so that he could be with her in the hospital on weekends. Guterres resigned as prime minister after his party lost badly in the 2001 local elections. \u201cPolitics are what they are,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there is a moment in which you need to recognize \u2026 you need to move to something else.\u201d \nFor Guterres, that something else was running the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which is tasked with protecting refugees and helping them either return to their home country or settle safely in a new one. During Guterres\u2019s tenure, from 2005\u20132015, refugee movements soared to unprecedented levels. In 2005, the number of refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced persons hovered under 40 million; by 2015, it had soared above 60 million. Guterres attacked the problem aggressively: He broadened the protection mandate at UNHCR to include people who were internally displaced within their own countries and migrants forced out by economic plight. He traveled constantly, visiting countless refugees\u2019 homes. \nFleming was alongside him most of the time, and she remembers a man who was driven by details. \u201cHe was always interested what the people were doing, how they were surviving,\u201d she says. \n\u201cHe is as at home sitting on the floor of a tent in the Beqaa Valley or talking to a Syrian refugee family as he is addressing the U.N. Security Council,\u201d says Angelina Jolie, who has worked with Guterres in her role as a special envoy for refugees. He also reduced staff costs and increased overall efficiency. \u201cI\u2019ve never see anyone read spreadsheets as carefully as he did,\u201d says one member of his inner office staff at Geneva. \u201cI think he actually likes reading spreadsheets.\u201d \nThe refugee crisis, largely the result of the implosion of Arab countries in the Middle East, especially Iraq and Syria, was hardly the U.N.\u2019s fault\u2014but Guterres told me he felt \u201can enormous frustration not being able to provide solutions. The solution of humanitarian problems is never humanitarian. The solution is political.\u201d\nIn early 2017, I traveled with the new secretary general to Zaatari, a temporary refugee camp for Syrian refugees and now the fourth-largest city in Jordan. Guterres, who shook every single hand of the local staff, exuded a sense of humility and ease that his predecessor, South Korea\u2019s Ban, often struggled to muster. This was Guterres\u2019 12th trip to Zaatari, which was built in 2012 as a camp for the tens of thousands of desperate people crossing the Syrian-Jordanian border. (Recent counts put its population at around 80,000.) Guterres took only a small entourage. \u201cHe likes to be nimble,\u201d the diplomat told me. \u201cBan took huge travel parties.\u201d\nWe visited a trailer where Syrian women were sewing clothes that they would later sell. Then we went to a makeshift school, and Guterres and his team filed in. The children stared as the older man fit himelf into one of the small desks and picked up a book. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d one of the girls asked Guterres, as the rest of the class burst into laughter. The secretary general laughed, too, flipping through an English book. \u201cThis is how I learned English too,\u201d he said.\nThe trip to Zaatari was probably one of the easier tasks Guterres had to tackle this past year. He arrived at an exceptionally challenging moment, with North Korea accelerating its nuclear weapons program, paralysis in the Security Council over the never-ending war in Syria, Trump-stoked doubts over the nuclear deal with Iran and climate change on the march. Many, if not all of these problems demanded U.S. attention, but in some respects were made more complicated by American involvement.\nThe refugee crisis was a case in point. The tide of refugees reached crisis level in 2015, when the number of people flooding into Europe, mostly across the Mediterranean Sea and across the borders of EU countries in the southeast, reached 1 million, more than triple the number of the year before. The influx gave rise to right-wing nationalist politicians across the continent. When we spoke in January, Guterres described the sense one might get from watching the news \u201cthat Europe was being invaded and that nobody was in charge.\u201d And this has \u201ccreated an anxiety and fear that was easily manipulated by political forces.\u201d\n***\nThe key to dealing with Trump as well as the other 192 members of the U.N., Guterres told me, was a lesson on negotiating he had learned from his first wife. \u201cWhen two people are in a room, in fact they are six,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat each person is, what each person thinks he is, and what each person thinks the other is \u2026 In any kind of negotiations or human relations, you have to bring six back to two.\u201d But with a president as mercurial as Trump, and as unpredictable, knowing which of his identities to engage with can be daunting. \nEarly on, Trump indicated human rights and multilateral agreements, pillars of the U.N., were not a priority. In April, the administration cut off funding to the U.N. Population Fund, an agency that provides family planning services, over the issue of abortion. \u201cJust 5 months into our time here, we've cut over half a billion $$$ from the UN peacekeeping budget & we're only getting started,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley tweeted in June. In June, Trump declared his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement: \u201cAs of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country,\u201d he said in a Rose Garden statement. At the time, a spokesman for Guterres said  the Paris decision was a \u201cmajor disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.\u201d \nGuterres might have been frustrated, but he did not let on. After meeting with Trump last April, he told Judy Woodruff on PBS NewsHour that the world needs a U.S. \u201cthat is engaged with security issues.\u201d\nIn mid-October, not long after Trump appeared before the General Assembly to lambaste the U.N. for its \u201cbureaucracy and mismanagement,\u201d the U.S. pulled funding from UNESCO, claiming the U.N. cultural organization displays \u201canti-Israel bias.\u201d Ronald Reagan had done the same thing in protest of the UNESCO\u2019s spendthrift habits, but many saw the unilateral move many saw as part of Trump\u2019s pattern of distrusting international organizations such as NATO. Less than a week later, Guterres visited the White House and evidently charmed the president enough that Trump gushed afterward the \u201cthings are going to happen with the United Nations that we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d\nThough Trump didn\u2019t specify what was coming, Guterres had no doubt briefed him on his work overhauling the tangled bureaucracy. The U.N.\u2019s recruitment system\u2014notorious for rewarding political cronies\u2014was opened to outsiders, a reform that has left some long-term U.N. staff not entirely comfortable. Guterres has replaced many of the old guard with career diplomats, mostly from Global South or African countries.\nGuterres\u2019s most ambitious organizational goal has been to rectify the gender imbalance throughout the U.N.\u2019s administrative ranks. Ban had placed significantly more men than women in senior management; within a year, Guterres has brought the ratio much closer to parity. Even before he took the office he named Amina J. Mohammed, a former Nigerian minister, as deputy secretary general; Brazilian diplomat Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti as cabinet chief; and Kyung-Wha Kang of South Korea to a newly created position as special adviser on policy. In August, he appointed Alison Smale, a former New York Times editor, to be under secretary general of global communications. He selected Alice Walpole, the former British ambassador to Mali and a divorced mother of six children, as his envoy to the U.N.\u2019s mission in Iraq.\nThere\u2019s a joke Guterres likes to use when describing his efforts to bring more women into the U.N. system. \u201cLook,\u201d he tells them, \u201cThere will only be equality when incompetent women are also in positions of responsibility, because there are plenty of incompetent men in positions of responsibility.\u201d\nBut the internal makeup of the U.N. bureaucracy, while an important issue, pales in comparison to the danger many diplomats believe Trump poses to the global order. \nAs I was wrapping up my reporting, Guterres was dealing with the aftermath of Trump\u2019s recent provocative foreign policy shift\u2014recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\u2014and the threat it poses to resolving the intractable conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, always a preoccupation at the U.N. \u201c[W]e pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect...\u201d he tweeted in early January. Then, just a couple of weeks later, the U.S. announced it would withhold more than half its scheduled $125 million payment from the United Nations Relief Works Agency, which provides humanitarian relief and other aid to Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nTrump\u2019s moves prompted the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, for the first time in 26 years to say the Palestinians won\u2019t go for a two-state solution anymore, but want full and equal rights within a democratic Israel. Guterres quickly responded to Trump\u2019s declaration. Without mentioning the president by name, he reminded people that he had \u201cconsistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect for peace for Israelis and Palestinians.\u201d Jersualem, he added, was a \u201cfinal status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiation between the two parties.\u201d \nStill, Guterres does not seem daunted. If anything, he appears to thrive on the challenges, say those who have observed him in the job. It\u2019s been a year since he assumed the mantle of one of the most difficult and possibly thankless jobs in the world. The war in Syria is still raging with a humanitarian crisis in Idlib; Trump is vowing to pull out of the nuclear deal with Iran; Muslim minorities are being threatened with genocide in Myanmar, causing another massive refugee crisis in neighboring Bangladesh. All these are unresolved challenges. But he could claim credit for one success. A few months back, over lunch with a reporter from the Financial Times, he said his biggest achievement was, in fact, in handling Donald Trump. \u201cWe have avoided disruption with the U.S.\u201d \n\n", "title": "Antonio Guterres\u2019 Most Important Peace-keeping Mission", "sourceId": "politico", "sourceName": "Politico", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/21/antonio-guterres-most-important-peace-keeping-mission-216489", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T12:02:55Z"}, {"textData": "Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and a champion of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, is considering forming a new pro-Brexit party, the Sunday Times reported.\n\nFarage is dismayed that UKIP, which long opposed Britain\u2019s membership in the EU, has been riven by internal politics and scandal in the 18 months since he resigned as leader, the Sunday Times said, citing unnamed people close to Farage.

The House is set to pass major bipartisan reform to the way the House handles claims of sexual harassment, and the speaker will apply these new standards to the allegations made against Mr. Meehan,\" Strong said.\n\"Following a conversation with the Speaker today, Mr. Meehan will immediately submit himself to the Ethics Committee for review,\" she added. \"The new reforms going into place bar the use of taxpayer money to pay settlements, and so the speaker has also told Mr. Meehan that he should repay whatever taxpayer funds were used to settle this case.\"\n\"In addition,\" Strong said, \"Mr. Meehan is being immediately removed from the House Ethics Committee.\"\nThe statement from Ryan's office comes after the Times reported that\u00a0Meehan allegedly\u00a0grew hostile\u00a0when\u00a0a former aide\u00a0did not accept his romantic overtures.\nThe pushback from Meehan and subsequent investigation destroyed the woman's life, the Times reports, forcing her to move back in with her parents amid mounting legal fees. She eventually settled with Meehan through the Office of Compliance, receiving a payout said to be in the thousands, though the total amount has not been made public.\u00a0\nThe settlement was paid from Meehan's congressional office fund, meaning it could be\u00a0disguised as salary and reported months\u00a0later.

After four years of Hollywood pumping out dozens of horrible movies smearing America\u2019s role in the War on Terror, Taken was a burst of fresh air in \u201908, a flash of reality that told the truth about Middle Easterners taking full advantage of France\u2019s over-tolerance as a means to engage in sex trafficking while the \u201cprogressive\u201d government looked the other way.\nAs a result, this little $25 million movie came out of nowhere to gross $227 million worldwide. Two sequels inevitably followed, and while they were nowhere near as good (Taken 3 is unwatchable garbage), the lingering goodwill of the first drove them to respective grosses of $376 million and $327 million.\nNaturally, with a franchise still this hot, television came calling in the form of NBC.\nBecause movie-era Bryan Mills was already retired and middle-aged, NBC\u2019s idea was to create an origin story. And so, 65-year-old Neeson (who is still as formidable as Charles Bronson was at that age) was replaced by 36-year-old Clive Standen and ten episodes ordered \u2014 which are now available on Netflix.\nI made it through only five.\nJust on the basis of competent and compelling storytelling, Taken fails a whole lot more than it succeeds. As Mills, Standen is nowhere near as imposing or intimidating as Neeson. Standen is too sweet for the role, more of a teddy bear on steroids as opposed to a guy haunted by the death of his sister, the event that opens the TV show.\nIt is also the death of his kid sister that encourages former Green Beret Mills to hook up with Christina Hart (Jennifer Beals) and her OPCON team of special intelligence operators.\nThe first two episodes are not great, but the action is good enough that you hang on in the hope things will improve. Unfortunately, it is in episode three where the collapse occurs, for it is here that Taken devolves into a super-lame piece of politically correct garbage.\nEpisode three not only treats us to lectures about all the (non-existent) anti-Islam bigotry in America, we also have Americans framing an innocent Muslim-American as a suicide bomber as a means to get the U.S. president (a woman, naturally) to be more aggressive in the Middle East.\nOn its own, this episode would be fine. The much-beloved 24 frequently hit us with this kind of story twist. But 24 was only interested in surprising us, not lecturing and hectoring us bigots from on high.\nAnd yet, somehow, things got even worse. The bad guys in episode four? A pharmaceutical company. Because as we all know, the gravest threats to America are the assassin squads employed by Johnson & Johnson.\nAt this point, in the futile hope Taken had gotten its woke-ness out of its system, I decided to hang in.\nBig mistake.\nIn episode five\u2019s painfully dull episode, after a top government official cheats on his wife with another man, he is blackmailed by an\u00a0eeeevil businessman. The story closes with a pious lecture from the Jennifer Beals\u2019 character about how homosexuals must have the courage to be true to themselves. She then demands that this poor guy tell his wife the truth about his super-okay gayness.\nOn what planet is her insinuation into this man\u2019s marriage okay? On what planet is Beals not seen as a super-bossy, totalitarian shrew blackmailing this man in her own way due to her own fascist need to order the world in a certain way?\nNot only is this episode immoral in its desire to turn Beals\u2019s heartless buttisnky into some kind of heroic Social Justice Warrior, not only is it a heavy-handed eye-roller, it violated the Rules of Woke. Could it be that this man identifies as bi-sexual in an open marriage? Who are we to judge his truth?\nThat was not even the episode\u2019s worst moment\u2026\nMonique Gabriela Curnen plays Visak, a skilled field operative who works with Mills. Visak is so competent, skilled, and woke, \u00a0she is \u2014 get this \u2014 triggered by the word \u201cdarling.\u201d\nTo make matters worse, she is triggered after one of her male colleagues refers to her as \u201cdarling\u201d while they are undercover posing as a couple.\nSo what we have here is a progressive TV show, and still it portrays as heroic a female character so weak and uptight she cannot handle the word \u201cdarling\u201d \u2014 even while undercover. If she is this easily provoked into losing her composure, how is Visak ever going to remain professional in the face of actual terrorists?\nBut, you know, there is nothing sexier than a neurotic chick with a firearm and no sense of humor.\nAlthough it was picked up for a second season (that just launched last week), Taken is already a ratings disaster. The season one premiere attracted 7.5 million viewers. By the end of that season, only 4.4 million bothered to tune in. Worse still, the season two premiere attracted only 2.8 million viewers.\nNBC\u2019s Taken is, in reality, the anti-Taken, the Bizzaro Taken, the exact opposite of everything that made the original movie so popular and enduring \u2014 an unstoppable man\u2019s man on a quest for vengeance against a threat that actually exists in our world, not the makers of Tylenol.\nIt is almost as if NBC spent $50 million just to insult Taken fans, to work out their own provincial and intolerant grudge towards a movie that dared appeal to Middle America.\nWe will have the last laugh, though. NBC\u2019s horribly expensive and dull lecture will soon be canceled and forgotten, while the original lives on long afterward.\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

If he wants to change something, he can, even if it negatively impacts near-term financial results,\" the pair told clients on January 17, in a note seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"It is concerning to us that Zuckerberg\u2019s focus is defined by 'meaningful social interactions' that are more interactive and less passive. There is much to admire in this focus, but as financial analysts, we tend to get a bit concerned when we see vote-controlling CEOs defining what is meaningful and interactive,\" Schacter and Alter said. It is relatively rare for equity analysts to criticise Zuckerberg, given the stock's meteoric rise.\n\nIn one sense, they are merely restating the obvious: Zuckerberg has long retained majority control of the stock, and has litigated and maneuvered to maintain that control even as he spends less time running the company on a day-to-day basis. So the note isn't a huge surprise.\n\nBut it is also a restatement of the fact that under Zuckerberg, Facebook has made mistakes. Most recently, in late 2016, Zuckerberg dismissed as \"crazy\" the idea that fake news propagated by Russian agents could have had an impact on the US presidential election that year. More recently, however, Facebook has admitted that 126 million people saw paid Russian propaganda on the social network before the election.\n\nThis latest announcement by Zuckerberg is an attempt to course-correct for the apparent ease with which disreputable media publishers can game the News Feed algorithm, and drive up bogus news inside your Facebook account.\n\nZuckerberg has long been obsessed with news inside Facebook. In 2013, he announced a redesign of the News Feed by saying, \"What we're trying to do is give everyone in the world the best personalized newspaper we can.\" He encapsulated that vision with an illustration of a mock local newspaper called the Monterey Times. In 2014, he tried again, launching a news-only app called Paper.\n\nCrucially, Zuck's vision for that \"newspaper\" has been local, personal, and relevant. His misreading of the scale of Russian influence in the 2016 election, and this latest move to quash fake news, suggests that he has a distaste for national, international or political news in the News Feed.\n\nThe Macquarie analysts \u2014 who rate FB as \"outperform\" \u2014 wrote:\n\n\"Again, we admire much of what he is doing, but from a purely near-term financial view, the headlines of the past year regarding social media\u2019s influence on society increases non-financial risks for FB, and these moves by Zuckerberg highlight that risk.\"\n\n\"... Zuckerberg plainly stated he expects time spent and some measurements of engagement will go down, but believes the changes will be good for the community and the business over the long-term.\"\n\n\"... It\u2019s Zuck\u2019s world, we all just post in it \u2013 This is also a casual reminder that when it comes to sweeping changes on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg is realistically the only one with a say in the matter. As of FB\u2019s most recent proxy statement last year, Zuckerberg holds 59.7% of the voting power in the company. Investors with a differing opinion have little recourse. GOOGL has a somewhat similar situation with Larry Page and Sergey Brin holding 51.1% of the vote, as well as Eric Schmidt with another 5.6%. However, the same isn\u2019t true across all large cap tech and social media, with none of the executives at AAPL, AMZN, or TWTR having full control of the vote. While we think that this change at Facebook is unlikely to stir much serious debate on the matter, it does serve as a reminder of the reality of the situation.\"", "title": "Zuckerberg's control of Facebook may be a threat to the value of the stock, Macquarie says", "sourceId": "business-insider", "sourceName": "Business Insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/zuckerberg-control-of-facebook-threat-to-value-of-stock-macquarie-2018-1", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:52:00Z"}, {"textData": "", "title": "Google CEO Has No Regrets About Firing Author of Anti-Diversity Memo", "sourceId": "fortune", "sourceName": "Fortune", "url": "http://fortune.com/2018/01/20/google-ceo-has-no-regrets-about-firing-author-of-anti-diversity-memo/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:51:17Z"}, {"textData": "\u201cWe will not negotiate over the status of people here unlawfully while Democrats shut down the government of the millions who are here lawfully,\u201d\u00a0a White House aide told Breitbart News on Saturday.\u00a0\nWhite House director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short and White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney confirmed the sentiment in a briefing\u00a0with reporters\u00a0at the White House.\n\nShort said that while they were open to further discussions on a DACA deal, they did not want a deal attached to the continuing\u00a0resolution\u00a0to fund the government.\n\u201c[W]e\u2019re not going to be held hostage and let our troops be held hostage over this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they reopen the government, we will continue the discussions.\u201d\nShort said that Trump\u2019s success in his first year as president was partially what prompted Democrats to shut down the government, accusing them of trying to impress leftist activists.\n\u201cThey look at the accomplishments of the last year and all this administration has accomplished, and their reaction is, \u2018Because we can\u2019t beat them, what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to shut down the government,'\u201d he said.\nMulvaney explained that\u00a0the Trump administration would try to diminish the pain of a shutdown, unlike the Obama administration during the 2013 government shutdown.\nHe said that employees in the EPA, cybersecurity agencies, and the national parks would continue to work as well as employees involved with\u00a0mine safety inspections and trade negotiations.\nBoth officials appeared baffled by the Democrats\u2019\u00a0decision to shut down the government,\u00a0asserting that there was nothing in the current funding resolution that Democrats actually opposed.\nThey confirmed that the president\u2019s trip to Florida was canceled and that his scheduled trip to Davos, Switzerland, was being considered on a \u201cday-by-day basis.\u201d\nMulvaney compared Senate Democrats to toddlers having a temper tantrum.\n\u201cIt is like a two-year-old temper tantrum to say, \u2018I will take my toys and go home because I am upset about something else,\u2019\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with this bill, and the Democrats are conducting a two-year-old temper tantrum in front of the American people.\u201d", "title": "White House: No Amnesty Deals for Illegals When Government of Lawful Americans is Shut Down", "sourceId": "breitbart-news", "sourceName": "Breitbart News", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/20/white-house-no-daca-deal-democrats-reopen-government/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:50:28Z"}, {"textData": "I think I spy a floor sign trend, guys. pic.twitter.com/22vypsuXQy", "title": "Senate Dems: Trump making negotiations 'impossible'", "sourceId": "the-hill", "sourceName": "The Hill", "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/369948-senate-dems-trump-making-negotiations-impossible", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:49:16Z"}, {"textData": "\n                 Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney (left) and White House legislative affairs director Marc Short hold a news conference about the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government at the White House on Jan. 20. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n                        Both Republicans and Democrats claim the coverage is skewed against them.\n\n            By JASON SCHWARTZ\n01/20/2018 04:48 PM EST\nUsually, when the government shuts down, a clear media narrative quickly takes hold: one party is driving the action, and therefore is held responsible.\nBut like so much else in the Trump era, this current shutdown is unprecedented. No single storyline has emerged, causing Democrats and Republicans to scramble for advantage and members of both sides to cry foul over coverage.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cWhen the narrative structure is clear, the headlines are all virtually identical. They\u2019re not,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhat that says is the press is dealing with a high level of complexity here.\u201d\nFor instance, Republicans crowed and Democrats cried foul Friday night when The New York Times sent out a push alert with the heading, \u201cSenate Democrats blocked passage of a stopgap spending bill to keep the government open. Lawmakers have less than 2 hours before a shutdown.\u201d\nYour guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.\nBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\nMeanwhile, The Washington Post push alert mentioned neither party, reading: \u201cGovernment barrels toward shutdown after Senate blocks short-term spending bill.\u201d\nFormer Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer screenshotted both, and tweeted, \u201cDo better @nytimes.\u201d \nThere were similar dynamics on the two papers\u2019 websites, with the Times running a headline saying \u201cDemocrats Block Bill to Fund Government,\u201d while the Post headline ran, \u201cSeveral Republicans join Democrats in voting to block short-term bill.\u201d \nThe AP ran a headline with wording similar to the Times, and its @AP_Politics feed tweeted out last night, \u201cThe Latest: Senate Democrats derail bill to avert shutdown.\u201d \nConservative sites The Daily Caller and Townhall.com pounced on the headlines, highlighting them in stories. \nThat all led the Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa to report on Twitter Saturday morning: \u201cHouse GOP read out headlines of NYT and AP, among others, and talked up idea this is a Dem-causes shutdown, per person there. Person adds that GOP holding to position and believe Senate Dems have to move toward them.\u201d\nBut the Times and AP are just two outlets. In the paper edition of the Times Saturday morning, the Democrats\u2019 role was not mentioned in the headlines. And both the Times and the AP have run several stories analyzing all angles of the shutdown. On Saturday afternoon, the lead Times story focused on Democrats and Republicans jockeying to assign blame. And the AP tweeted and reported today, \u201cIn run-up to shutdown, an erosion of trust derailed talks\u201d\u2014not just Democrats. \nSome conservatives have chafed, in fact, that the Democrats are not being more squarely blamed for the government closure, like Republicans were in 2013 when House Republicans demanded that the government be shut down unless Obamacare was gutted. \nThe conservative Washington Examiner, for instance, ran a column late Friday headlined, \u201cDemocrats' government shutdown has the media's full support.\u201d\nJamieson said that the lack of consensus across media pointed to a story that was unusually complicated. \n\u201cIn this environment, the narrative is not a clear narrative. It\u2019s a cluttered narrative. It doesn\u2019t produce press stories that say \u2018blame here, credit there,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cGo back to every [shut down] in the past, and you\u2019ll see a clear issue, you knew where the sides were and it was easier to say they\u2019re the ones doing the shut down. The shut down should be blamed on X.\u201d\n\n\nAmong the confounding factors now, Jamieson said, is that some Republicans have sided with Democrats. There is, moreover, the blown-up deal between senators Dick Durbin and Lindsay Graham, as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s last-minute negotiations with Chuck Schumer. And, above all, the president\u2019s own confounding role in the whole drama\u2014at times he\u2019s seemed amenable to a compromise deal on allowing undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to stay here, and other times not.\nFrank Sesno, the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said that he believes coverage has been \u201cTypically hysterical but generally responsible.\u201d \nMost networks and outlets, he said, have done a good job unpacking the nuances of the story, rather than firmly biting on either the Democrats\u2019 or Republicans\u2019 talking points. \n\u201cI think the coverage has been actually very substantive, at times even perhaps mystifying to people because there\u2019s so much congressional procedure and process involved in all this,\u201d said Sesno, a former longtime CNN reporter and anchor.\nFox News, meanwhile, has taken the expected pro-Trump line: on Saturday morning\u2019s Fox & Friends, hosts spoke of the \u201cSchumer shutdown,\u201d and FoxNews.com ran a headline blaring \u201c#DEMOCRATSHUTDOWN\u201d and \u201cTrump targets Dems for playing \u2018shutdown politics\u2019 as Congress tries for new deal.\u201d\n\nPolitics\n\n            By POLITICO STAFF\nBut other networks, similar to the Times, have spent more time reporting on how Republicans and Democrats are working to assign blame. The lead story on CNN Saturday morning, for instance, was headlined \u201cBlame game\u201d and covered the two parties\u2019 maneuvering.\n\u201cIt seems like both sides are working the refs here. It's a more complex situation this time around, with the GOP controlling Congress and the presidency, but most of the reports I've seen seem to juggle that point with the vote last night,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia School of Journalism professor who previously served as one of The Wall Street Journal's top editors, in an email.\n\u201cAt this point -- Saturday afternoon -- the impact of the shutdown is minimal, and the details are so confusing, that I don't think most readers or viewers are swayed by an adjective or phrasing that a partisan finds objectionable,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd the evidence I've seen to support bias, outside of Fox, seems thin.\u201d\n\n                                            By Janine di Giovanni\n\n                                            By Dan Diamond\n\n                                            By Jeff Greenfield\n\n                                            By Gordon F.

A rally sent oil prices nearly 6 percent higher for the year, to trade at their best since December 2014. Crude has surged 133 percent since hitting a multi-year low of $27.30 a barrel in February 2016.\n\nHowever, market conditions do not currently support crude oil above $60 a barrel, says John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital and a veteran market watcher. He expects a pullback to more reasonable levels in the near-term.\n\n\"As we get into the new year now and another season of refinery maintenance and much lower gasoline demand, I see the base case fundamentally as arguing for lower prices from here at least for a while,\" Kilduff told CNBC's \"Futures Now\" this week.\n\nHigh U.S. oil production could also put a dampener on the crude rally, added Kilduff, potentially negating the benefits of a deal among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to restrict supply even further. That would effectively support prices.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that production growth in the U.S., Canada and Brazil would bump non-OPEC supply higher by 1.7 million barrels per day in 2018. U.S. crude supply alone could surpass 10 million barrels a day \u2014 beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia for the title of world's largest oil producer.\n\nKilduff sees a range of $50 to $55 a barrel as more appropriate for the current market. Crude oil last settled as low as $55 in November, and closed above $63 in Friday's trading.\n\nIn a silver lining for commodity traders, Kilduff does not see a return to the lows seen in 2015 and 2016, when prices cratered below $30. High production levels and weak demand for oil set off a crude selloff in late 2014 that stretched through to early 2016.\n\n\"We're certainly out of the woods that we were in 18 months ago or so when there was abject oversupply of crude oil and refined products,\" said Kilduff. \"The global glut has been worked off to a large degree, in part because of the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement, but also because of other exogenous events that occurred.\"\n\nOPEC members have largely complied with an output deal that has contributed to a correction of the global imbalance between supply and demand. A agreement to cut production went into effect at the beginning of 2017, and is set to expire at year's end after several extensions.\n\nTwo major pipeline outages, including the Keystone XL pipeline, and a string of devastating hurricanes in the latter half of 2017 helped to balance the domestic oil market.

Congress found out early Saturday morning what happens when no one does.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have spent months locked in a collision course on immigration, convinced the other side would cave. And after a failed vote to keep government open on the Senate floor late Friday night into early Saturday morning, not only were they proven wrong -- both sides dug in deeper.\n\nWhite House legislative director Marc Short told reporters on Capitol Hill Saturday morning that there would be no further negotiation on how to address the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program until the shutdown ended.\n\n\"As soon as they reopen the government we'll resume negotiations on DACA, but it's hard to negotiate on that while they're keeping our border agents unpaid, keeping our troops unpaid, and not paying for American services,\" Short said.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats continued to insist that the promise of a future vote on immigration wasn't enough, as they didn't trust that it would actually materialize.\n\n\"We're trying to get to not just reopening the government, doing it as quickly as we can, but doing it in an effective way so we can address the issues that are pending,\" said No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin on Saturday.\n\nHe added that in 2013, when the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration deal partially authored by him that died in the House, he learned a lesson.\n\n\"We don't want a similar fate,\" Durbin said. \"What we're looking for is not a guaranteed outcome, but an opportunity outcome. A free standing bill is not a very great opportunity.\"\n\nHow we got here\n\nThe dramatic shutdown marked the finale of at least one phase in the months-long dance between Republicans and Democrats since President Donald Trump decided in September to terminate the DACA policy , a popular program that protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children.\n\nTrump's move happened as congressional leadership was working through negotiations on long-term government funding, with only short-term continuing resolutions passing Congress since. While budget talks have been working through a number of sticking points, including domestic versus defense spending caps, children's health insurance and disaster relief, it is immigration that has proved the thorniest issue for either side to budge on.\n\nFor Republicans, it was essential to isolate immigration as an issue, with the hope of gaining more leverage by dragging it closer to a March deadline on DACA and forcing Democrats to give up their budget negotiating power. The thinking went that Democrats would not only get desperate to protect the young immigrants, but that vulnerable Democratic senators would balk at rejecting funding if it was perceived as only about DACA. Republican leadership also feared the reaction from its base if it allowed a vote on a so-called \"amnesty\" on must-pass legislation.\n\nFor Democrats, in contrast, the focus was on keeping immigration as part of the fabric of all the issues, showing the base it wasn't something that could be jettisoned for convenience and maintaining negotiating leverage. The only way they could trust a vote would happen in a GOP-controlled Washington, Democrats were convinced, was if DACA was part of must-pass legislation.\n\nBoth sides were convinced for months their side was the stronger position. As days grew closer to the Friday deadline, Democrats only grew more confident they could avoid blame, especially after Trump rejected in vulgar terms a bipartisan compromise that a handful of Republicans were vocally supporting. Republicans remained convinced that red-state Democrats wouldn't be able to survive the pressure.\n\nBut in the end, neither blinked.\n\nNo signs of thaw\n\nAs the shut down stretched into Saturday, neither side looked any closer to showing signs of movement.\n\nRepublicans continued to blame Democrats for shutting down the government over a single issue, insisting they were willing to negotiate. Democrats continued to blame Republicans for being disingenuous and untrustworthy, demanding they get serious and stop kicking the can further down the road.\n\n\"It's totally inexcusable, shutting down the government as a bargaining chip for any issue,\" Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee, said Saturday in the Capitol. Alexander has backed the bipartisan DACA bill rejected by the President. \"It ought to be like chemical warfare, it ought to be banned. It ought not to be a tool,\" he added about shut downs.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn said he and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke with their House counterparts from the Senate floor late Friday and they remained steadfast despite requests to add immigration to the mix that it would not be part of a must-pass bill.\n\n\"There's no reason to shut down the government in order to encourage us to the table on DACA because we're already at the table,\" Cornyn said, though the only immigration talks he said he was scheduled to participate in Saturday were among Republicans alone.\n\nDemocrats continued to hammer the idea that they were the ones looking for reasonable solutions.\n\n\"Look, at this point, I'm not supporting any CR that doesn't include a fix,\" said Illinois Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, long a pro-immigration advocate. \"Now, what I am telling you is, if that fix includes a wall, I'm ready.\n\nAnd Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who voted for a continuing resolution in December, said he'd lost his patience on Friday night before voting against the failed proposal with most of his colleagues. He said without \"credible progress\" on a number of issues, including DACA, he couldn't support the bill.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make sure that my Republican friends understand how a reasonable Democrat like me has ended up in a place where I don't believe that they're at all serious about addressing DACA in the next month, given the way the President blew up a pretty solid bipartisan deal last Thursday,\" Coons said.", "title": "Congress' DACA game of chicken goes off the cliff", "sourceId": "cnn", "sourceName": "CNN", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/20/politics/daca-game-chicken-congress/index.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:44:24Z"}, {"textData": "(Reuters) - President Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress failed to meet a midnight Friday deadline to pass a short-term bill to extend federal funding, forcing some government facilities to shutdown.\n\nIn shutdowns, non-essential government employees are furloughed, or placed on temporary unpaid leave. Workers deemed essential, including those dealing with public safety and national security, keep working.\n\nAfter previous government shutdowns, Congress passed measures to ensure that all unpaid workers received retroactive pay. The Trump administration would support a similar measure, a senior administration official said on Friday.\n\nWorkers began finding out on Friday whether they would be furloughed, but official notices would come as early as Saturday. They would receive their last paycheck for work up until the shutdown on Friday Jan. 26.\n\nThe last shutdown, in October 2013, lasted more than two weeks and more than 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. There is no official tally of how many would be off work this time. Here are some details about what happened in 2013, along with some recent updates from officials:\n\nMILITARY: The Defense Department says a shutdown would not affect the U.S. military\u2019s war in Afghanistan or its operations against Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria. All 1.3 million military personnel on active duty would remain on normal duty status. Civilian personnel in non-essential operations would be furloughed. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said a sustained funding impasse would cause ships to go without maintenance and aircraft to be grounded.\n\nJUSTICE: The Justice Department has many essential workers. Under its shutdown contingency plan, about 95,000 of the department\u2019s almost 115,000 staff would keep working.\n\nFINANCIAL OVERSIGHT: The stock market-policing Securities and Exchange Commission funds itself by collecting fees from the financial industry, but its budget is set by Congress. The markets watchdog said in a statement on its website that it would remain open for a limited number of days, fully staffed. The S.E.C. said this plan focused \u201con the market integrity and investor protection components of our mission.\u201d\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, meanwhile, would have to furlough 95 percent of its employees immediately. An agency spokeswoman said the derivatives regulator could, however, call in additional staff in the event of a financial market emergency.\n\nWHITE HOUSE: More than 1,000 of the 1,715 staff at the White House would be furloughed, the Trump administration said. The president would be provided with enough support to carry out his constitutional duties, including staff needed for a planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, administration officials said. However, the decision to go to Davos is now being assessed \u201cday to day\u201d the White House budget director said on Saturday.\n\nNATIONAL PARKS: National parks remain accessible while still following all applicable laws and procedures, according to a spokesperson. Open roads will remain accessible and back country toilets will also remain open. However, services requiring staffing like public information and full service restrooms, will not be operating. Some lodging, restaurants, and other services may be available when provided by concessioners or other entities.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York Harbor are closed as are Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center and other historic buildings in Philadelphia\u2019s Independence National Historic Park normally staffed by federal personnel.\n\nNational parks were closed in 2013 and it resulted in a loss of 750,000 daily visitors, said the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association. The National Park Service estimated the shutdown resulted in $500 million in lost visitor spending in areas around the parks and the Smithsonian museums.\n\nWASHINGTON TOURIST SIGHTS: In 2013, popular tourist sites such as the Smithsonian closed, with barricades going up at the Lincoln Memorial, the Library of Congress and the National Archives. The Trump administration does not plan to barricade open-air monuments this time, officials said. The Smithsonian has said its museums could remain open through Monday.\n\nTAXES: The Internal Revenue Service furloughed 90 percent of its staff in 2013, the liberal Center for American Progress said. About $4 billion in tax refunds were delayed as a result, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\nMAIL DELIVERY: Deliveries would continue as usual because the U.S. Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations.\n\nTRAVEL: Air and rail travelers did not feel a big impact in 2013 because security officers and air traffic controllers remained at work. Passport processing continued with some delays.\n\nCOURTS: The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has said federal courts, including the Supreme Court, could continue to operate normally for about three weeks without additional funding.\n\nHEALTHCARE: In 2013, the Medicare health insurance program for the elderly continued largely without disruption. Hundreds of patients could not enroll in National Institutes of Health clinical trials, according to the OMB. A program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track flu outbreaks was temporarily halted in 2013. This time, the CDC will continue its work to track the flu outbreak, an official said.\n\nCHILDREN: Six Head Start education programs in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina serving about 6,300 children shut for nine days in 2013, the OMB said.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY: Social Security and disability checks were issued in 2013 with no change in payment dates and field offices remained open but offered limited services. There were delays in the review process for new applicants.\n\nLOANS: Processing of mortgages and other loans was delayed when lenders could not access government services such as income and Social Security number verification. The Small Business Administration was unable to process about 700 applications for $140 million in loans until the shutdown ended, OMB said.\n\nVETERANS: Most employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs would not be subject to furlough. VA hospitals would remain open and veterans\u2019 benefits would continue, but education assistance and case appeals would be delayed, the department said.\n\nFOOD INSPECTIONS: Department of Agriculture meat inspectors stayed on the job. Agricultural statistical reports ceased publication. The USDA\u2019s website went dark.\n\nENERGY: The Department of Energy said on Friday that since most of its appropriations are for multiple years, employees should report to work as normal during a shutdown until told otherwise. If there was a prolonged lapse in funding a \u201climited number\u201d of workers may be placed on furlough.", "title": "Factbox: What happens in a U.S. government shutdown?", "sourceId": "reuters", "sourceName": "Reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-shutdown-impact-factbox/factbox-what-happens-in-a-u-s-government-shutdown-idUSKBN1F9145", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:42:58Z"}, {"textData": "It's been another busy week in Washington, so check your local listings and tune into \"Face the Nation\" this Sunday morning.

Whoever you listen to, their explanation for the shambles is political.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the left you blame President Trump \u2013 just as you blame him for everything from bad weather to burned toast. If you\u2019re on the right you call it the \u201cSchumer Shutdown\u201d \u2013 after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u2013 and point out that today\u2019s Democrats are being driven by their extreme \u201copen borders\u201d base.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I agree that the Democrats are in thrall to their party\u2019s extremes, in particular on the issue of immigration. And it surely makes sense to handle the DACA issue as part of a negotiated immigration deal, including the border wall and an end to the diversity visa lottery and chain migration.\n\nUsing the \u201cDreamers,\u201d as DACA recipients are known, to hold up agreement on the entire federal budget is a ridiculous and damaging stunt.\n\nAbout 700,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children are temporarily allowed to stay here under the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, which was created under an executive order issued by President Obama in 2012. However, President Trump wants to end DACA in March unless Congress takes action to allow DACA recipients to stay in the U.S.\n\nBut none of this explains the real underlying cause of the federal government shutdown that began Saturday. The reason we have to put up with this seemingly endless succession of short-term crises and stop-gap fixes is not political, it\u2019s structural.\n\nThe shutdown is not in fact an example of the system failing. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect to happen given the system we have.\n\nWhy can\u2019t they agree a proper long-term budget in Congress? Because everyone in Congress is fighting for their piece of the pie \u2013 and the bigger the pie, the bigger the fight.\n\nMore significantly, it\u2019s a fight members of Congress wage for their political survival \u2013 because the piece of the federal pie that they\u2019re fighting for is not for their constituents, it\u2019s for the people who really matter to them: the donors and interests that got them to Congress in the first place.\n\nOn the left it\u2019s typically the unions (especially the public sector unions) with their money and grassroots organizing power; on the right it\u2019s more often big business and big donors.\n\nGetting appropriations that keep their sponsors happy: that\u2019s the name of the game in these budget negotiations. It\u2019s the Swamp in action.\n\nThe only long-term answer is a radical rethink of the entire federal government, transferring most of its functions to the state and local level where they would be carried out more effectively and with more accountability.\n\nFor decades now, starting with President Ronald Reagan, we\u2019ve had politicians from both parties make promises about cutting the federal government and its associated bureaucracy. But it never happens \u2013 the federal government just grows and grows, giving more and more power to Congress and the bureaucrats.\n\nI know from personal experience inside the British government that piecemeal efforts to slim down government bloat will always fail. The bureaucracy will always win. The only answer is, in fact ... a shutdown.\n\nNot a temporary, crisis-driven shutdown. But a long-term, carefully considered, complete and total shutdown of every function of the federal government that could be carried out closer to the people: education, health care, housing, social services, transportation ... almost all of it apart from the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury and Justice.\n\nOf course, the Swamp-dwellers who have grown fat off our current, corrupt system would fight with everything they have to hold onto their power and influence. The lobbyist-funded ski trips and weekend getaways would soon dry up if there were no appropriations to dish out in return.\n\nIt will take a political revolution to wrench power out of the hands of the Washington establishment and put it in the hands of the people. But don\u2019t bet against it: just look at the evident, embarrassing failure of the current system and its shameless corruption.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how revolutions start.\n\nWe\u2019ll be debating all this on Sunday night on \u201cThe Next Revolution\u201d at 9 p.m. EST on FNC.

That's a drop of about 36% in less than a month \u2014 a collapse that qualifies as a market crash.\n\nPeople are casting around for an explanation. Why should this wildly popular new form of payment exchange, which feels like the future, suddenly drop in value? There are a large number of good reasons to sell bitcoin. And that's part of the problem \u2014 on most days it feels like there are more reasons to sell than to buy.\n\nBut the most obvious headwind comes from governments.\n\nRussia, South Korea, China, Algeria, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan have all outright banned bitcoin or made noises about tightening regulation around crypto that would make owning the currency much less attractive. South Korea is moving toward an outright ban even though 10% of the entire bitcoin market is traded in South Korean won, according to Coin Hills.\n\nLast week, the European Securities & Markets Authority said it might consider banning contracts-for-difference based on cryptos.\n\nGovernments are testing one of bitcoin's central promises: That the alt-currency is somehow immune to regulation because it offers uncrackable security with total anonymity. In theory, cryptocurrency enthusiasts will tell you, crypto allows you to hoard staggering wealth and the government can't touch it. (That's why criminals like it so much.)\n\nIt's a nice dream but it requires you to believe that governments will stand idly by while people abandon fiat currency. The government is not going to sit on its hands while people figure out how to stop paying taxes on both their income and capital gains because they are accepting payments via crypto. That would be insane. If there is one thing that governments are good at doing, it's making sure the government never goes away.\n\nOf course the government wants to tax your bitcoin earnings. Of course the government isn't going to let you pay taxes in bitcoin (it's going to require real currency).\n\nIt's not just about creaming off the tax, or making sure the government can see how you earn money.\n\nIt's about the basis of civil society itself.\n\nMoney \u2014 fiat currency \u2014 underpins everything. Literally, everything.\n\nGovernments only stay in business because they have the power to control how much cash flows through the economy. They can create new money or reduce the amount in circulation. Their interest-rate-setting powers control the cost of everything, from the price of patching a pothole in the street to the cost of war in the Middle East.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies came even remotely close to becoming the preferred form of cash, then governments would be out of business. The idea that The Man is going abdicate that power to software? Dream on.\n\nBitcoin will lose this battle.\n\nGovernments will move more slowly than tech, sure.

The lawmakers said Trump had expressed enthusiasm and amenability to the bill before suddenly changing his mind in just two hours.\n\nThe lawmakers have accused White House staff members, such as chief of staff John Kelly and policy adviser Stephen Miller, of hijacking the negotiations by pushing hardline immigration view upon the president, making bipartisan compromises impossible.\n\n\"Tuesday we had a president that I was proud to golf with, call my friend, who understood that immigration had to be bipartisan, you had to have border security,\" Graham said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. \"But he also understood that you had to do it with compassion. I don't know where that guy went. I want him back.\"\n\nA nearly identical situation occurred Friday, Schumer said, after he met with Trump at the White House over cheeseburgers and hashed out a tentative agreement that included Trump's long-promised wall along the US-Mexico border and the full amount of defense funding requested by the Pentagon.\n\nEven those measures were not enough to appease the hardline conservative faction of the Republican party, Schumer said. Trump called back hours later proposing different terms.\n\n\"They called back again, 'Well, we're going to need this, this, this in addition,'\" Schumer said. \"Things they knew were far, far right and off the table.\"\n\nSchumer is not the first lawmaker to publicly express frustration with Trump's wavering views \u2014 even Republican leaders have called him out.\n\n\"I'm looking for something that President Trump supports, and he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign,\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday. \"As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels.\"", "title": "Schumer: 'Negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O'", "sourceId": "business-insider", "sourceName": "Business Insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/schumer-negotiating-with-president-trump-is-like-negotiating-with-jell-o-2018-1", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:09:08Z"}, {"textData": "President TrumpDonald John TrumpDems flip Wisconsin state Senate seat Sessions: 'We should be like Canada' in how we take in immigrants GOP rep: 'Sheet metal and garbage' everywhere in Haiti  MORE did not approve an outline of his immigration policy crafted by top Homeland Security staff at a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers on immigration two weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0\nA lawmaker who attended the televised meeting earlier this month tells\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0that after Trump ordered\u00a0cameras out\u00a0of the room, the president reacted in surprise and shock to the summary of his policy positions on immigration that\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen NielsenKirstjen Michele NielsenDHS chief takes heat over Trump furor Overnight Cybersecurity: Bipartisan bill aims to deter election interference | Russian hackers target Senate | House Intel panel subpoenas Bannon | DHS giving 'active defense' cyber tools to private sector Hoyer blasts Trump for 'racist rhetoric'  MORE and her staff passed out.\nTrump\u00a0reportedly outwardly expressed frustration that\u00a0he was unaware\u00a0of the\u00a0outline\u00a0until\u00a0the meeting, saying he disagreed with\u00a0the four-page document's \"must haves\" and proposals for an immigration deal.\u00a0\nThe president told lawmakers gathered in the\u00a0meeting to disregard the outline, which listed several of his key\u00a0proposals, including $18 billion in funding for a border wall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the wedding where someone actually stands up and objects to the wedding,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0lawmaker told the Post. \u201cIt was that moment.\u201d\u00a0\nDuring the televised portion of the meeting, Trump said that any\u00a0legislative solution for the thousands of \"Dreamers,\" immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children, should be a \"bill of love.\"\u00a0\nDemocrats pushed for a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that was ultimately stonewalled by Trump and Republican leaders in the Senate, resulting in a federal shutdown at midnight on Friday.\u00a0", "title": "Trump didn't approve DHS outline of immigration deal 'must haves': report", "sourceId": "the-hill", "sourceName": "The Hill", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/369941-trump-didnt-approve-dhs-outline-of-immigration-deal-must-haves", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T21:07:16Z"}, {"textData": "Sen.

President Trump continues to hold strong support from a few key groups, but he has made no permanent gains among the larger coalition of Americans that began the year in opposition to his presidency.\n\nHowever, while his approval rating has remained relatively constant, some previously undecided voters have moved into the \"disapprove\" camp. As a result, President Trump's disapproval rating rose ten points over the past year, from 48 percent in February 2017 to a majority of 58 percent today.\n\nDisapproval climbs among independents\n\nAmong independents the shift is even more dramatic, since many independents had yet to make up their minds when Mr. Trump first took office. Whereas in February, less than half of independents (46 percent) said they disapproved how President Trump was handling his job, previously undecided independents have swelled that percentage to a majority of 60 percent today \u2013 a 14-point rise.\n\nDisapproval rises among \"somewhat\" conservative, white evangelicals, though they still back Trump\n\nConservatives, unlike liberals and moderates, continue to support the president in strong numbers. But while approval among liberals and moderates started low and remains low, support among conservatives, though high, has dropped slightly \u2013 from 71 percent in February to 65 percent now.\n\nThe shift is among those who say they are only somewhat conservative - a group that makes up the majority of conservatives and one in five Americans overall. While most Americans who say they are somewhat conservative still approve of how Donald Trump is handling his job as President, disapproval among this group has risen 15 points \u2013 from 25 percent in February to 40 percent today. In contrast, support among very conservative Americans \u2013 who make up 14 percent of the total \u2013 has not changed significantly.\n\nAnother group that remains firmly behind the President is white evangelicals. Eight in 10 evangelicals voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 general election, and Donald Trump's approval rating among white evangelicals has been consistently strong since he assumed office \u2013 hovering in the mid-sixties. Nevertheless, disapproval among this group has risen 11 points since February, from 22 percent to 33 percent.\n\nBlack Americans strongly disapprove, and now white Americans disapprove, too\n\nEntering the Oval Office, white Americans approved of the job President Trump was doing by a margin of nine percentage points (49 - 40 percent). By summer, however, more whites disapproved than approved of how Donald Trump was handling his job. Just over half of white Americans (51 percent) continue to disapprove today.\n\nBlack Americans, on the other hand, have overwhelmingly disapproved of the President's job performance from the beginning. But even their disapproval rating has risen, from 83 percent in February to 96 percent today.\n\nBoth men and women disapprove\n\nBack in February more men approved (48 percent) than disapproved (41 percent) of the job Mr. Trump was doing by a margin of seven points. Now, just over half of men \u2013 54 percent - disapprove.\n\nMeanwhile, a majority of women have continued to disapprove, and that percentage has risen since the beginning of the year \u2013 from 55 percent in February to 63 percent today.\n\nOlder Americans now disapprove, too\n\nDisapproval has risen among all age groups as well. While younger Americans have expressed disapproval of President Trump's job performance, Americans 45 and older approved of the job Mr. Trump was doing \u2013 at least at first.

When John F. Kennedy won by the thinnest margin of any U.S. presidential election up to that time, his inaugural address acknowledged it was \u201cnot a victory of party but a celebration of freedom.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, after George W. Bush, like President Trump, won the election but lost the popular vote, he pledged to work with former rival Al Gore \u201cto do our best to heal our country.\u201d\n\nIn his 2016 victory speech, President Trump similarly promised to be \u201cpresident for all Americans\u201d and called on all parties to \u201cbind the wounds of division\u201d in order to \u201ccome together as one united people.\u201d But since that time, the president has only catered to the needs of a single constituency \u2013 his base \u2013 and to the exclusion of all other groups.\n\nPresident Trump must commit himself to consistently cooperate across party lines and work on behalf of all Americans \u2013 even those who did not vote for him. If he does, his accomplishments can defend Republican seats in the November midterm elections and enhance chances for GOP victories in 2020.\n\nDespite his reluctance to act as uniter-in-chief, President Trump has achieved several notable accomplishments during his first year in office. If the president is able to shift his governing style to be more consistent and inclusive, taken with his accomplishments, this display of leadership would propel him towards a victory in 2020.\n\nFor instance, the economy has undeniably surged under President Trump. The Dow Jones industrial average recently reached 26,000 for the first time. In December, the national unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent, the lowest level since 2010.\n\nThe newly-signed GOP tax cuts are an important achievement for President Trump. Approximately 46 percent of Americans approve of the tax law, according to a mid-January New York Times survey. For the first time in years, companies are able to give bonuses to their employees \u2013 and they\u2019re crediting the tax overhaul.\n\nIn response, consumer confidence has skyrocketed. Now 42 percent of Americans believe the national economy is better than it was a year ago, according to the New York Times poll.\n\nYet President Trump continues to vacillate between appeasing his base and throwing rhetorical bones across the aisle, leaving little room for bipartisan negotiation or compromise.\n\nOn his signature issue of immigration, President Trump conveyed dramatically mixed messages. In early January, he called on Congress to pass a \u201cbill of love\u201d to resolve the fate of the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program and strengthen immigration policy.\n\nUnder DACA, about 700,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children are temporarily allowed to stay. However, President Trump is seeking to end the program, which was created under an executive order issued by President Obama, unless Congress votes by early March to give DACA recipients legal status.\n\nUnfortunately, when a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement several days ago providing a path to citizenship for DACA recipients and increased funding for border security \u2013 a good deal for both parties \u2013 the president waffled. He called the proposal a \u201cbig step backwards,\u201d said DACA was \u201cprobably dead,\u201d and that the Democrats were to blame.\n\nPotential infrastructure plans are similarly waylaid by President Trump\u2019s flip-flopping. His insistence on funding for a southern border wall \u2013 contradicted by Chief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s suggestion that the president had \u201cchanged his attitude\u201d \u2013 shifted yet again with President Trump\u2019s claim that his position has \u201cnever changed or evolved.\u201d Such waffling threatens the possibility of this major bipartisan project.\n\nUltimately, the American people are unhappy with President Trump\u2019s fluctuations and divisiveness. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released January 17, 64 percent of voters believe the president is doing more to divide the country than to unite it.\n\nThe latest Real Clear Politics average of public opinion polls says 40 percent of Americans approve of the job President Trump is doing in office and 55 percent disapprove.\n\nUltimately, the lesson is simple: if an elected leader attempts to be inclusive, his or her approval ratings will go up. This was evident with President Clinton, with President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and with President Obama at the beginning of his term. A little unity can go a long way come election season.\n\nPresident Trump must commit himself to consistently cooperate across party lines and work on behalf of all Americans \u2013 even those who did not vote for him. If he does, his accomplishments can defend Republican seats in the November midterm elections and enhance chances for GOP victories in 2020.\n\nDuring his 2016 election night speech, President Trump proved he knows how to unite Americans and inspire confidence. In one night, he singlehandedly created huge economic value as the Dow soared.\n\nThat was then, this is now. But the American people still want a president for all Americans.\n\nIf he can deliver, President Trump will triumph.", "title": "Doug Schoen: One year into the Trump presidency, a call for unity - Fox News", "sourceId": "fox-news", "sourceName": "Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/01/20/doug-schoen-one-year-into-trump-presidency-call-for-unity.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T20:42:52Z"}, {"textData": "next\n\nprev\n\nClashes have broken out in Honduras as demonstrators protesting President Juan Orlando Hernandez's re-election blocked roads in several locations and police moved into to break up the barricades.\n\nPolice say four officers were injured Saturday, one seriously.

Patrick Meehan, R-Pennsylvania, settled a misconduct complaint after a former aide had accused him of making \"unwanted romantic overtures.\"\n\nMeehan, 62, had reportedly expressed an interest in the young woman's life and the aide had regarded the congressman as a sort of \"father figure,\" according to those close to the office and those who the woman had discussed her time in the office with.\n\nIt was when the woman had entered a serious relationship with someone outside of her office, Meehan reportedly professed his romantic interests in her, both in person and in a letter. Those familiar with the aide's experience say Meehan then grew hostile when the aide did not reciprocate.\n\nThe aide then filed a formal complaint with the congressional Office of Compliance after her time in the office grew increasingly aggressive and toxic. The Times writes that the aide followed the standard practice as part of the complaint process, but received pushback from Meehan's office and congressional lawyers who alleged the aide had \"misinterpreted\" Meehan's advances.\n\nShe later reached a confidential agreement with Meehan's office which included a settlement for an undisclosed amount.\n\nHis removal from the Ethics Committee was sift. Ryan's spokesperson announced it within hours.\n\n\"Speaker Ryan takes the allegations against Mr. Meehan very seriously,\" said AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Ryan. \"The speaker is committed to rooting out sexual misconduct in the House and providing victims the resources they need. The House is set to pass major bipartisan reform to the way the House handles claims of sexual harassment, and the speaker will apply these new standards to the allegations made against Mr. Meehan. Though Mr. Meehan has denied the allegations, they must be fully and immediately investigated by the House Ethics Committee. Following a conversation with the Speaker today, Mr. Meehan will immediately submit himself to the Ethics Committee for review. The new reforms going into place bar the use of taxpayer money to pay settlements, and so the speaker has also told Mr. Meehan that he should repay whatever taxpayer funds were used to settle this case. In addition, Mr. Meehan is being immediately removed from the House Ethics Committee. Any further action or comment will come pending a full and prompt investigation by the Ethics Committee.\"\n\nRevelations of the complaint follows that of a wave of similar allegations leveled against members of congress including Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan and Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, among several others at the tail end of 2017. The increasing allegations spawned new calls for stronger legislation on Capitol Hill that sought to prevent and respond to sexual harassment in Congress and to change the arduous system in place for reporting incidents.\n\nBut Meehan's case is particularly of note due to the Republican being a well-known advocate on behalf of victims of sexual assault.\n\nMeehan worked with assault victims as a prosecutor in Pennsylvania and continued that work in Congress, being a proclaimed \"leader in the effort to protect the victims of brutal crimes such as sexual assault,\" according to his congressional website.\n\nIn July of 2016, Meehan had introduced the \"Duty to Report Sexual Assault Act of 2016\" to require owners and employees of massage parlors to report allegations of sexual assault to law enforcement.\n\n\"Reporting alleged assault will help victims understand their rights, like pursuing an investigation and pressing charges, and the resources available, such as local sexual assault programs,\" Meehan had said in a press release on the legislation.\n\n\"Claims of sexual abuse should be taken seriously,\" Meehan continued. \"They should be investigated and pursued in accordance with the victim's wishes.\"\n\nMeehan also endorsed the Violence Against Women Act and took part in bipartisan working groups to \"combat sexual violence on college campuses and in the military.\"\n\nMeehan is also a member on the House Ethics Committee, the same panel which has initiated investigations into sexual misconduct claims against at least four members of congress in 2017.\n\nThe Times notes that the exact amount of the settlement between Meehan and the aide \"could not be determined,\" due to the fact that Meehan's office paid it from a congressional office fund, allowing for payments to be disguised as salary and reported months after they were made. Those familiar with the payout said it was thousands of dollars.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, Meehnan denied the allegations against and said that he has \"always treated his colleagues, male and female, with the utmost respect and professionalism.\"\n\nMeehan said that investigatory process, at the guidcance of the House Counsel and hte Ethics Committeee, was handled \"ethically and appropriately.\"\n\n\"At Congressman Meehan's request, the congressional attorneys handling the case have asked the complainant's counsel to release all parties from the confidentiality requirements of the agreement to ensure a full and open airing of all the facts.

Since the genetic test also matches you with those who might be related to you, Dones noticed that Anthony Dones, now 15, was matched with a woman named Patti Bosques in Lindberg, New York.\n\n\nShe decided to reach out via the genetic company's website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Dones was born July 11, 2002.

After searching through the National Marrow Donor Program, they had no luck. But then doctors searched for a donor through the New York Blood Center, and Tracey Dones said she was \"thrilled\" to learn doctors found a match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll she knew about the donor was that it was from a newborn baby, born in North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York in 2001.\n\n\nWhat she'd figure out some 15 years later, after taking her Ancestry DNA test, was that the donor was Sam Bosques. He's the youngest child of Patti and Jose Bosques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatti Bosques told ABC News she doesn't remember much about her son's birth. In fact, she doesn't even remember donating his umbilical cord's blood.\n\n\n\"I remembered doing it for my daughter [Olivia, now 18]... and then my son was born two-and-a-half years later, but I don\u2019t really remember anything,\" she admitted with a laugh. \"But Anthony was proof that I did.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Tracey Dones reached out via Ancestry DNA to Patti Bosques, the woman who saved her son's life, she didn't hear anything. So she reached out via Facebook.\n\n\nPatti Bosques had just come home from a lengthy vacation. Being that it was days before Thanksgiving, she decided to put it off until after the holiday.\n\n\nBut Tracey Dones was undeterred, needing to thank the woman for what she had done over a decade ago.\n\n\n\"It turns out Anthony\u2019s dad played softball with her nephew.

Rarely has every American community seen the nation\u2019s challenges through a single prism. Even more rarely have we all agreed on any given solution. But through the decades, and with rare exceptions, those representing us in Washington have found ways to work things out. They\u2019ve collaborated and compromised, bantered and bartered. And it\u2019s through those negotiations that the flame of American democracy has survived.\nAs illustrated by the current impasse over border security and immigration, that light has begun to flicker. Deep down, I have no doubt that Democrats and Republicans both want what\u2019s best for America. It\u2019s just that they\u2019ve lost their ability to negotiate with one another. They\u2019re so entrenched in their various positions\u2014so convinced that their worldview should transcend everyone else\u2019s\u2014that they\u2019re unwilling to meet anyone halfway. The result is a democratic unraveling.\n\nIt\u2019s time we reviewed how compromise is\u00a0supposed\u00a0to work. Governing, after all, isn\u2019t designed to be a game of chicken. Nor is it supposed to be a system where winners take all. Rather, America\u2019s constitutional democracy was designed to require that legislators on both sides of every issue take the other side\u2019s concerns seriously, consider what they can accommodate (and what they cannot), and then work out something that is better than the status quo. But that tradition has broken down.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0what\u2019s not normal.\nDemocracy simply doesn\u2019t work if both sides view the other side\u2019s demands as unreasonable simply because the other side has made them. No friendship could ever work that way. Nor could any marriage. And that\u2019s what the left and right are in today: A dysfunctional marriage where each side\u2019s obsession with what they want\u2014and their reflexive rejection of the other side\u2019s desires\u2014has come to undermine everyone\u2019s shared commitment to the greater good.\nThe debate over immigration and border security is a case in point. Deep down, neither side really objects to what the other side proposes. Support or oppose the \u201cwall,\u201d no one disputes that America should have secure borders. Indeed, whether or not you prefer to welcome more immigrants or send back those who are already here, nearly everyone believes that explicitly unwelcome foreigners should be repelled from the homeland. And while leaders can disagree about specifically\u00a0how\u00a0you accomplish that goal, no one thinks we ought to leave a back-door border entrance open and unguarded.\nAt the same time, no matter how you feel about the immigration issue more generally, very few Americans believe that the Dreamers\u2014individuals who were brought to the U.S. as children and have since abided by the law\u2014should be sent home. Even President TrumpDonald John TrumpDems flip Wisconsin state Senate seat Sessions: 'We should be like Canada' in how we take in immigrants GOP rep: 'Sheet metal and garbage' everywhere in Haiti  MORE has asked on Twitter: \"Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military?\" So the issue isn\u2019t whether these particular immigrants should remain in the United States\u2014it\u2019s whether letting them stay might open the door to others.\nIn other words, neither side disagrees fundamentally with what the opposing party wants. These disagreements are eminently resolvable. But each side\u2019s preeminent demand prompts the other side to draw a red line. The roots of the current impasse aren\u2019t substantive\u2014they\u2019re political.\nNow, in any healthy relationship, this is the easiest sort of problem to solve. Why? Because, in the absence of any truly substantive disagreement, both sides can get the bulk of what they want without having to give too much to the other side. The left could save the Dreamers because they\u2019re not\u00a0really\u00a0opposed to security at the border. The right could have a more impenetrable barrier at the border because they don\u2019t really want to deport hardworking Americans.\nBut the relationship between the Democrats and Republicans\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0healthy\u2014and that\u2019s the problem. Both sides care more about ensuring that the other side\u00a0not\u00a0get what it wants than they do about getting what they care about most. So if they can\u2019t solve this sort of problem\u2014namely one in which their substantive disagreements are minimal\u2014how can we ever expect them to tackle challenges where they truly disagree?\nInside Congress, a growing faction recognizes this very problem. The Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 48 House members, is working to put substance above politics\u2014and they\u2019re having an impact. The hard truth is that if something doesn\u2019t change to improve the relationship between the two parties, the fragile institutions of American democracy may become too brittle to repair.

It was too little, too late; even as the conversation continued, the clock struck midnight and the shutdown officially began.\n\nThis is what governing from crisis to crisis looks like. Weeks -- months even! -- are spent on political positioning, stalling and doing everything you can to avoid actually talking to people on the other side of the aisle for fear of the political blowback within your party's base.\n\nThe problem with that approach is that the actual work of legislating comes only in paroxysms of panic. Which is totally and completely unsustainable -- as evidenced by the 112 continuing resolutions that have been used to keep the government operating since 1998\n\nThink of it this way: Your job is to make 100 widgets in a year. Rather than making two-ish widgets a week for the entire year, you spend the first three quarters of the year making zero widgets. For the next two months, you up your widget building, but you aren't working all that hard or spending any extra hours on the job. With one week before your deadline, you still have to make 50 widgets. You work harder, but with one day left, you still have 30 widgets to make. And now your boss is standing over you, looking at his watch every few minutes. Even if you start making widgets faster than you ever have before, it's a) likely your widgets won't be of the best quality (because you are rushing) and b) very unlikely you make your deadline.\n\nThat's what you've seen happen in Congress over the time between the last continuing resolution on Dec 22, 2017, and last night. Congress eventually started to do its job, but you just can't make 30 widgets in a single day. Imagine how things might have turned out if they had started having serious conversations -- House/Senate, Republicans/Democrats, Trump/Congress -- prior to a few days (or even hours!) before the government was shuttering.\n\nMy point is this: Yes, the shutdown of the federal government amounts to a total failure of Congress to do its job. (Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander suggested Saturday that shutdowns be prohibited; \"It ought to be like chemical warfare, it ought to be banned,\" he told CNN's Tal Kopan .)\n\nBut, we can learn from failure. And those moments with Schumer, Graham and 15 or so other senators late Friday night should be the standard to which we hold our elected officials going forward.\n\nDon't like what the other side is doing or saying? Convince them why they're wrong! Talk to them! Engage! Don't retreat into your partisan corners and turn your headphones up as loud as they go.\n\nIf we learn nothing from this shutdown, we'll be destined to repeat (and repeat) (and repeat) it, which is bad for everyone.", "title": "A picture from the shutdown that will make you believe government can still actually work", "sourceId": "cnn", "sourceName": "CNN", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/20/politics/shutdown-analysis-cillizza/index.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:28:15Z"}, {"textData": "(Reuters) - As midnight neared on Friday and the U.S. government barreled toward a shutdown, Republicans and Democrats sought to apportion blame for the deadlock with a battle of social media hashtags.\n\nBy the time the deadline had passed without a deal and exhausted senators returned home to bed, #TrumpShutdown was fast becoming the top trending item on Twitter worldwide.\n\nIn an early indication of who was being held responsible for the impasse in Washington, at least among users of the social networking site early on Saturday, that hashtag beat competitors including #DemocratShutdown and #GOPShutdown.\n\n\u201cThis will be called the #TrumpShutdown,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tweeted after government funding expired. \u201cThere is no one who deserves the blame for the position we find ourselves in more than President (Donald) Trump.\u201d\n\nMany who shared the hashtag decried a lack of leadership from the Republican president, in sharp contrast to his self-crafted image as a dealmaker who would make Washington work.\n\nAs both parties exchanged online blows, some of Trump\u2019s supporters, including White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, sought to push the hashtag #SchumerShutdown.\n\nA year into Trump\u2019s presidency, Sanders wrote on Twitter, Democrats could not shut down the country\u2019s booming economy, so they shut down the government instead.\n\n\u201cThis is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators,\u201d Sanders tweeted. \u201cDo your job Democrats: Fund our military and reopen our government #SchumerShutdown.\u201d\n\nBy Saturday afternoon the hashtag #TrumpShutdown had been used some 2.6 million times on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, according to social media analytics platform Talkwalker.

In December 2017, NIST released the second draft of its framework. Among the updates were two critical additions to the Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control guidance.\nThese updates address the disturbing reality that our digital identities are surprisingly unsecure. More than\u00a09 billion credentials have been stolen since 2013, giving cyber criminals an abundance of personally identifiable information to use to commit fraud, from account takeover attacks, to fraudulent credit applications and more. By combining\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0guidelines with behavioral biometric identity proofing and authentication solutions, organizations can fight back against these shocking statistics to detect and prevent fraud.\nWhat is the\u00a0NIST Framework?\n\n\u00a0\nRather than being shocked by each new data breach, ransomware attack or instance of fraud, companies are increasingly working to improve their cybersecurity posture, and not just internal information security professionals. Business leaders and c-suite level executives are waking up to the importance of putting resources behind their organization\u2019s cybersecurity, from the insurance industry to financial institutions. Companies are finding the\u00a0NIST Framework\u2019s guidance particularly helpful in a time when cyberattacks are costly and growing at an alarming rate. Every 39 seconds, there is an\u00a0attack on a computer with internet access\u00a0and cyberattacks are priced at an estimated $400 billion globally per year.\nMeeting\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0Identity Management and Authentication Guidelines with behavioral biometrics: Behavioral biometrics are specifically designed to address the identity management and authentication guidance added under the \u201cprotect\u201d section of the\u00a0NIST Framework\u2019s second draft. Using behavioral biometrics, organizations can employ advanced identity proofing and authentication technology to detect fraud and prevent unauthorized access.\nIdentity proofing with behavioral biometrics\nThe\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0recommends that \u201cidentities are proofed and bound to credentials and asserted in interactions when appropriate.\u201d Identity proofing is a process organization\u2019s use to collect and verify information about a person for the purpose of an account opening or issuing credentials to that person. Most often, identity proofing is used to meet regulatory requirements and prevent fraud.\nTypically, companies rely on database searches to verify user information entered into online applications. These traditional identity proofing methods are no longer sufficient, however, as the information required to open new accounts is readily accessible to cyber criminals due to large-scale data breaches. In fact,\u00a0one in nine of all online accounts created in 2017 was fraudulent.\nBehavioral biometrics fulfill\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0guidance for identity proofing by monitoring user behavior when filling out online applications, not just that the correct information is entered. Working in the background, behavioral biometrics verify that online applications are being filled out by genuine users, not fraudsters, by testing for application fluency, navigational fluency and low data familiarity.\nFor example, fraudsters often use keyboard shortcuts and enter unfamiliar data in a way not exhibited by legitimate users. Based on these parameters, organizations can effectively verify user identity, in real-time, and experience less fraud.\nRisk-based, multi-factor authentication and behavioral biometrics\nThe second update to the\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0that behavioral biometrics can address relates to risk-based, multi-factor authentication. Specifically, the\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0recommends that \u201cusers, devices, and other assets are authenticated (e.g., single-factor, multifactor) commensurate with the risk of the transaction (e.g., individuals\u2019 security and privacy risks and other organizational risks).\u201d\nBehavioral biometrics go a step farther and meet these requirements by providing continuous authentication, not just single or multi-factor authentication. Rather than requiring users to provide a static identifier, like a password or fingerprint, behavioral biometrics monitor user behavior from login to logout to detect suspicious activity throughout a user session, not just at log in. This is important because 100 percent of fraud occurs in authenticated sessions, clear evidence that traditional authentication methods are still failing to catch cyber criminals.\nEven multi-factor authentication has\u00a0already proven vulnerable to attack. Working behind the scenes, behavioral biometrics collect data on user interactions with a device, establishing a unique identity profile that can\u2019t be duplicated. How one user moves their mouse, for example, can\u2019t be recreated by a cybercriminal or remote access trojan. This entire authentication process takes place without the user knowing \u2014 a win for\u00a0customer experience.\nWhen needed, behavioral biometrics can also introduce additional authentication measures if suspicious activity is detected. This could be a prompt to enter a password or use another biometric like a fingerprint or facial scan. This type of multi-factor authentication is significantly more secure than knowledge-based security.\nUsing behavioral biometrics, organizations can meet and exceed\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0guidelines around authentication to better secure users, online transactions and the business as a whole.\nThe\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0is an excellent place for organizations to begin improving and updating their cybersecurity process. In June 2017, NIST also released a\u00a0Special Publication (SP) 800-63, a document outlining Guidelines on Digital Identity. The document replaced outdated authentication and identity proofing recommendations with new ones, meant to align with the types of cyber threats organizations are facing today. This includes providing adequate identity proofing and authentication solutions to prevent unauthorized access, activities and transactions.\nAdvanced technology solutions, like behavioral biometrics, are helping organizations put\u00a0NIST Framework\u00a0recommendations into practice. When it comes to preventing fraud, account takeover, malware or other cyberattack, behavioral biometrics provide the best option for ensuring users are who they claim to be.\nFrances Zelazny is vice president of\u00a0BioCatch, a cybersecurity company that delivers behavioral biometrics to protect users and data.

Turkey's military is calling the campaign Operation Olive Branch.\n\nTurkey says the YPG -- a group it considers a terrorist organization -- is an extension of an outlawed Kurdish rebel group that it is fighting inside its own borders, and it has found common cause with Syrian opposition groups who view the YPG as a counter-revolutionary force in Syria's multi-sided civil war.\n\nAssociated Press journalists at the Turkish border saw jets bombing positions in the direction of Afrin, as a convoy of armed pick-up trucks and buses believed to be carrying Syrian opposition fighters traveled along the border. Video from Turkey this week showed the military moving tanks to the frontier.\n\nRojhat Roj, a YPG spokesman, confirmed the strikes, saying they were the first by the Turkish military on the city. He said ten civilians were wounded, three seriously.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said, meanwhile, that it was pulling back troops that had been deployed near Afrin, two days after Turkey's military and intelligence briefs travelled to Moscow to discuss the planned operation. It said the group of observers was being relocated to another area. It was not immediately clear how many troops were affected by the move.\n\nThe YPG is the driving force behind a coalition of north Syrian forces allied with the U.S. to battle the Islamic State group. With U.S. support, including around 2,000 embedded forces, the coalition now controls close to a quarter of Syrian territory, concentrated mostly to the north and east of the Euphrates River.\n\nTurkish leaders were infuriated by an announcement by the U.S. military six days ago that it was going to create a 30,000-strong border force with the Kurdish fighters to secure northern Syria. Days later, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that the U.S. would maintain a military presence with the Kurds for the foreseeable future.\n\nSpeaking in the city of Kutahya in western Turkey, Erdogan announced an expansion to Turkish operations in Syria, promising to move on the Kurdish-controlled town of Manbij and its surrounding countryside after completing operations in Afrin. The operation would force out the Kurdish militia from all positions west of the Euphrates River.\n\nIn 2016, Turkey trained and equipped opposition forces to drive Kurdish fighters out of parts of north Syria, driving a wedge between two enclaves along the Turkish frontier. Turkish ground forces, including tanks and artillery, crossed into Syria with the fighters to establish a zone flanked by Afrin and Manbij that now serves as hub for Turkish operations inside the war-torn country.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the strikes on Afrin marked the start of a campaign to \"eliminate the PYD and PKK and Daesh elements in Afrin,\" referring to the Kurdish Democratic Union Party and the Kurdistan Worker's Party respectively, and using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. The PYD, PKK, and YPG all look to the Kurdish Marxist-nationalist leader Abdullah \u00d6calan as their guide. \u00d6calan is imprisoned by Turkey for waging a separatist movement in the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe air strikes were accompanied by waves of artillery strikes on the Afrin region.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu discussed the operation with Tillerson by phone on Sunday after the U.S. diplomat requested a conversation, Turkish officials said. They did not provide further details.\n\nAny ground operation would entail considerable military and political risk for Ankara. Russia was keeping military observers in Afrin and lately firmed up its ties with the YPG, while Syria's government in Damascus said it would shoot down any Turkish jets on raids in the country. The YPG is estimated to have between 8,000 and 10,000 fighters in Afrin.\n\nTurkey could also face blowback from the Kurdish insurgency within its own borders.\n\nA ground offensive or continued shelling would exacerbate the poor humanitarian situation in Afrin, which is now home to at least 800,000 civilians, including many who arrived fleeing the fighting in other parts of Syria.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Syrian government forces and supporting militias retook a key air base in northwest Syria lost to rebels in 2015. Syria's state broadcaster said Syrian troops fought their way into the strategic Abu Zuhour air base on Saturday, in Idlib province.\n\nIt was a coup for the government and allied militias who advanced swiftly to take the base in what was considered a stronghold for rebels and al-Qaida insurgents.\n\nBut the advance, which began in earnest in late December, has displaced more than 200,000 civilians, according to the U.N., exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the north of the country.", "title": "Turkish jets bombard Kurdish-controlled city in Syria", "sourceId": "cbs-news", "sourceName": "CBS News", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turkish-jets-bombard-afrin-a-kurdish-run-city-in-syria/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:13:22Z"}, {"textData": "A Toronto man who worked as a mall Santa Claus has been charged in the murders of two men.\n\nThe man, Bruce McArthur, 66, was arrested on Thursday after police found evidence that he was linked to the disappearance of Andrew Kinsman and Selim Esen, the Toronto Star reported.

And on Saturday, women and some male supporters again gathered in Washington and hundreds of cities to protest against the president and in support of protection for illegal immigrants and other liberal causes.\n\nWhile the Saturday protests were underway, Congress was trying to figure out how to reach agreement on a spending bill to end the government shutdown that began Saturday morning.\n\nDonning pink hats resembling women\u2019s sacred body parts suddenly exposed for all to see, protesters last year expressed fury that against all odds a white, male Republican who never before held public office somehow bested their longtime feminist-in-chief Hillary Clinton. How dare he stop Hillary from shattering the glass ceiling!\n\nThe glass ceiling the protesters had envisioned shattering entirely was instead left in shards that got under their skin \u2013 deep under their skin.\n\nThe glass ceiling the protesters had envisioned shattering entirely was instead left in shards that got under their skin \u2013 deep under their skin.\n\nAfter much public dialogue over the last year, the questions must now be asked: What exactly has the Women\u2019s March accomplished and are the protesters capable of turning their angst into action? Will Saturday\u2019s protests accomplish anything more, or just serve as a self-affirming feel-good moment for President Trump\u2019s opponents?\n\nWhile the Women\u2019s March last year certainly served as an outlet for liberals to gather and share their \u201celection depression,\u201d there was no real call to action. There was no plan for attendees to return to their respective hometowns, run for office, nor do anything differently than they had done before the 2016 election. Quite frankly, without that kind of action the Women\u2019s March risks becoming nothing more than annual group therapy.\n\nWhether the protesters can now turn their angst into action remains to be seen. Thus far, the Women\u2019s March already falls short on tangible results when compared to other recent populist movements.\n\nBy comparison, the Tea Party movement that sprang in the spring of 2009 accomplished far more in their inaugural year than the Women\u2019s March has.\n\nIn record speed from the moment the movement was invoked on February 19, 2009 from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange \u2013 to the ensuing raucous Tea Party rallies that played out on the steps of cities from coast to coast \u2013 Americans watched as their government was taken back by the people.\n\nHowever, the Tea Party movement didn\u2019t stop at the rallies. They quickly rolled up their sleeves and got to work, putting aside their differences with their own party and often volunteering at local GOP headquarters, signing up for campaigns, knocking on doors and mobilizing \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d efforts.\n\nUnlike the Women\u2019s March, the Tea Party movement\u2019s swift action yielded instantaneous results that were impressive; record-breaking, in fact.\n\nIn 2010, just one year after launching, the Tea Party movement helped Republicans regain control of the House of Representatives. Credit was widely given to the Tea Party, which staged vigorous protests of Congress members\u2019 town hall meetings back in their home districts, successfully shined a light on House races and made ObamaCare a central issue.\n\nIn 2014, the Tea Party movement helped Republicans win the U.S. Senate and win the largest Congressional majority in American history. With the staggering loss of 50 seats in Congress, Democrats suffered their largest defeat in decades.\n\nAnd in 2016, in arguably a continuation of the populist revolution, the Tea Party helped put Donald Trump in the White House in what Politico called the biggest upset in American history.\n\nThe Women\u2019s March has no such scalps on the wall. In fact, the movement hasn\u2019t yielded any new stars.\n\nWhereas the Tea Party movement spawned stars such as Republican Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Joni Ernst of Iowa \u2013 both leaders in their respective classes today \u2013 no one has wanted to attach themselves to the Women\u2019s March.\n\nHowever, leaders of the Women\u2019s March may have realized their risk of falling into political oblivion, because the organization announced new components to Saturday\u2019s marches.\n\nThe protesting women are launching a nationwide voter registration campaign to recruit more women to vote, and aim to affect the midterm elections in November.\n\nThe strategy just might work as the Women\u2019s March has joined forces with Rock the Vote, a movement that registered youth to vote in the 1992 presidential election and impacted the presidential race in favor of the saxophone-playing, boxers-or-briefs-clad Bill Clinton.\n\nIf the Women\u2019s March is able to recruit talented people from Rock the Vote who succeeded in previous voter registration outreach campaigns, the group has a chance to deliver on its promise.\n\nIf the Women\u2019s March is able to recruit talented people from Rock the Vote who succeeded in previous voter registration outreach campaigns, the group has a chance to deliver on its promise.\n\nAs the new year unfolds and the midterm elections loom, the Women\u2019s March has a real opportunity to shift from \u201cprotest\u201d to \u201cpragmatism.\u201d\n\nWhether or not the Women\u2019s March can make the transition will determine whether the movement is a force to be reckoned with, or will simply go down in history as a passing fad worth not much more than the cheap yarn from which its pink hats were spun.", "title": "Women's March -- Are we watching a movement or just group therapy for Trump haters? - Fox News", "sourceId": "fox-news", "sourceName": "Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/01/20/women-s-march-are-watching-movement-or-just-group-therapy-for-trump-haters.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:08:53Z"}, {"textData": "TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran soldiers and police clashed with protesters blocking roads across the Central American country on Saturday, as discontent continues to fester nearly two months after a disputed presidential election.\n\nAt least one person died as security forces launched tear gas against rock-throwing supporters of the center-left Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship and tried to clear impromptu roadblocks of burning tires they had set across the capital Tegucigalpa and around the country, according to police sources and TV images.\n\nHonduras, a poor, violent country that has long sent vulnerable migrants north to the United States, has been embroiled in a political crisis since the Nov. 26 election, which the opposition says was stolen by center-right President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Mrs. Trump is at a 47% favorable rating, while the President's approval number stands at 40%, according to the CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nThe first lady has for the most part seen steady positivity for much of the past year, peaking in March at 52%, but holding in the mid-to-upper 40s for the past several months. At a private, black-tie dinner at the White House last September, the President introduced his wife to guests by calling her, \"the star of the Trump family,\" saying, \"they love her out there, I'll tell you. We walked all over Florida. We walked all over Texas, and they're loving Melania, and she just enjoys helping them with what she's doing and working with you folks.\"\n\nOne year ago, Melania Trump's approval number stood at 36%, with a whopping 23% having no opinion of her whatsoever. Today, that figure stands at 16%, as Mrs Trump, whose profile is admittedly lower than that of her predecessor, Michelle Obama, continues to develop a signature cause and grow more comfortable with her public role.\n\nThese latest results put Mrs. Trump's unfavorable rating at 37%, while her husband's disapproval is at 55%. And while Mrs. Trump is herself an immigrant, her favorable number among that group only stands at 23%, while 50% of those born in the United States give her a positive ranking. As expected, Republicans are Mrs. Trump's top supporters, at 79% favorable, versus 23% of Democrats who view her positively. And she continues to be more popular with men than women, 53% as opposed to 41%, respectively. Younger Americans aren't as pleased with the first lady as the older generation; her biggest fans according to this poll, are over the age of 50.\n\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 14-18 among a random national sample of 1,005 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer.

That's defined by the IRS as between January 1 and April 30, 2018, according to the agency's 2018 Lapsed Appropriations Contingency Plan.\n\nRelated: Here's what the last government shutdown looked like\n\nThe contingency plan gives examples of the IRS functions that will continue throughout the shutdown. They include processing electronic returns, testing upcoming filing year programs, and computer operations to prevent the loss of data.\n\nAmong the functions the IRS will not perform during a shutdown: audits, return examinations, non-automated collections, and issuing refunds.\n\nUnless the shutdown drags on for weeks, the refund you're owed for 2017 likely won't be affected. Why? The IRS already announced it wouldn't start accepting 2017 tax returns until January 29.\n\nSo in the short term, the people most likely to be affected by the halt on refunds are those who are owed them for earlier tax years.\n\nThe Treasury and IRS have the option to reassess how many people they need working and what functions may be performed.\n\nIf this shutdown lasts more than five days, however, there could be changes. Treasury, which issues the IRS contingency plan, has the option to change its mind on whether it will keep withholding returns.\n\nThere's also a chance the House and Senate will reopen the government by Monday. Both chambers are working over the weekend in the hopes of putting a stop gap measure in place.\n\nRelated: Will enough tax be withheld from your paycheck? Good question\n\nBut there are no guarantees, and a shutdown is the last thing the IRS needs right now.\n\nThe agency is in the midst of implementing the most significant tax code overhaul in more than 30 years.\n\nEven before a shutdown loomed, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson warned that the IRS needs more funding and staffing in order to adequately implement the new tax law.\n\nThat includes a need for more staff to help answer the questions millions of Americans will inevitably have.\n\nEven before the new tax law was signed in December, the IRS was projecting that its representatives would only be able to handle four out of every 10 taxpayer calls in fiscal year 2018.", "title": "What's happening at the IRS during the shutdown", "sourceId": "cnn", "sourceName": "CNN", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/20/pf/taxes/irs-taxes-government-shutdown/index.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T19:00:11Z"}, {"textData": "PRAGUE (Reuters) - Two people died and nine were injured in a fire at a hotel in the centre of Prague on Saturday night, fire and rescue officials said.\n\nThe fire occurred at Eurostars David Hotel, a block away from the Vltava River and near the Czech capital\u2019s National Theatre.\n\nOf those hurt, five people were seriously injured, the Prague Emergency Medical Service said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we were not able to help two people,\u201d the EMS said on its Twitter.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nNo other details on the victims were given.\n\nSeznam Zpravy news website reported the hotel has 152 beds.\n\nRescue officials had earlier said 40 were injured, although Czech media reported that most were treated for smoke inhalation on the spot and not taken to hospital.\n\nThe cause of the fire was not clear.", "title": "At least two dead, dozens hurt in Prague hotel fire", "sourceId": "reuters", "sourceName": "Reuters", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-czech-fire/at-least-two-dead-dozens-hurt-in-prague-hotel-fire-idUKKBN1F90ZT", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:59:04Z"}, {"textData": "MORONI (Reuters) - Comoros has sold citizenship to nearly 52,000 foreigners since 2009, the government said in the first official statement on the scale of a passports-for-cash deal with Gulf states.\n\nMost of the documents had been sold under an approved scheme but there had been abuses that led to some Iranians buying passports, which had sparked tensions with Gulf allies, the country\u2019s foreign minister said.\n\nComoros struck a deal with the United Arab Emirates in 2008 to sell economic citizenship to stateless Bidoon people living in the Gulf in exchange for cash for the poor Indian Ocean nation.

A clear falsehood from the White House podium.\n\nAnd that was just the first 24 hours.\n\nIn his first year in office President Trump proved to be a singular figure, casting aside norms and traditions, fighting with Republicans and Democrats alike and changing how the nation and the presidency are viewed at home and abroad.\n\nSeemingly each day spawned several can-you-believe-it headlines that would have defined a previous president's term. But in the hyper-accelerated Trump news cycle, many were forgotten by the next morning.\n\nAppropriate for a former reality TV star, Trump's first year was can't-miss drama, full of unforgettable characters, surprise casting changes and innumerable plot twists. It came against the backdrop of a deeply polarized nation, a looming nuclear threat, whispers about the president's fitness for office and, for good measure, the shadow of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe reviews weren't kind. Mr. Trump's first-year approval rating stood at 39 percent, the lowest of any president. But viewers couldn't look away.\n\nPresident Trump's first year was one marked by chaos and controversy, as he cast aside norms and traditions and changed how the presidency is viewed at home and abroad. For anyone thinking year two might be different, think again. (Jan. 19)\n\n\"He is a compulsively watchable political character,\" said Jon Meacham, presidential historian and biographer. \"The country elected the most unconventional president in our history and he has proven to be just that. To me, the story of the first year is the atmospheric chaos that the president has created, sustained and perpetuated.\"\n\nMr. Trump was the first president to be elected without any government or military experience. And from the first moments of Mr. Trump's inauguration, it was clear that Washington had never seen anything like this before.\n\nHis inaugural speech was a dark pitch to the nation's forgotten, suggesting a retreat from the world under the slogan of \"America First.\" It soon led to an uproar over the White House press secretary's wild claims about the inauguration crowd size.\n\nSoon, other crowds were the story.\n\nMillions of people flooded streets around the globe for the \"Women's March\" to protest Mr. Trump's presidency. That set the template for the so-called #Resistance, which swarmed airports just days later when the White House suddenly announced its travel ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThere would be little attempt from Mr. Trump to bring those protesters into the fold. Despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, the president forged forward as if elected with a sweeping mandate, aiming his policies directly at his base \u2014 with moves such as the rollback of environment regulations and civil rights protections \u2014 and blaming Democrats for any Washington failure.\n\nAlways eager to have a foe, Mr. Trump governed as he campaigned, and not just by incessantly reliving his 2016 election over Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump frequently instigated fights and rarely let a slight go unanswered via his favorite weapon, his Twitter account.\n\nAny pre-inauguration talk of restraining his Twitter usage was soon forgotten. He used the 140-character \u2014 and later, up to 280 \u2014 bursts to target foes, traffic in conspiracy theories, salute the programming on Fox News, rattle Congress and unnerve world capitals. In March, he even made the unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor had wiretapped Trump Tower, and he labeled President Barack Obama a \"bad (or sick) guy.\"\n\nThe trail of tweets has roiled the capital for 12 months. Across Washington, phones would buzz with alerts anytime Mr. Trump tweeted. Republicans found themselves to be targets of Trump's tweet just like Democrats, particularly when their efforts to repeal Obama's health care law \u2014 a plan seven years in the making \u2014 failed not once, but twice.\n\nSome tweets drew puzzlement; none more than the president's late-night posting of the nonsensical word \"covfefe.\"\n\nSome tweets challenged American institutions, full of criticisms of the media and the FBI. Others provoked outrage, as when he suggested that MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski had a face-lift or claimed that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., \"would do anything\" for a donation, an unsavory insinuation made at the height of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe discussion about sexual harassment toppled many powerful men but, while Mr. Trump's own accusers resurfaced, the White House never changed its story: The women were not telling the truth.\n\nThat was just one of many moments in which Mr. Trump appeared almost eager to foment divisions, including racial ones.\n\nHis political career was launched on the lie that Obama was not born in the United States, and this month, Trump was denounced for dismissing African nations as \"shithole countries\" when he urged a limit on immigration from that continent.\n\nHe dismissed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as \"Pocahontas,\" mocking her claims about being part Native American, while addressing a group of American Indians. More divisively, he blamed \"both sides\" for the violence between neo-Nazis and anti-hate group protesters that left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump was rewriting the rules of behavior within the Oval Office, his agenda was largely lifted from the Republican playbook and his first year victories thrilled the GOP orthodoxy. He appointed conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, rolled back business regulations, presided over a massive tax cut and, the White House argued, fostered an environment that freed the stock market to boom.\n\n\"2017 was a year of tremendous achievement (and) the achievements for our country, our people, and for our standing in the world have been very monumental,\" Mr. Trump said at a Cabinet meeting last week, before offering a glimpse into how he views the presidency \u2014 as catnip for cable.\n\n\"I'm sure their ratings were fantastic. They always are,\" he said.\n\nLike any president, Mr. Trump faced crises during his first year.\n\nMost ominously, North Korea escalated its nuclear weapons development program while Trump responded with unprecedentedly bellicose rhetoric. He warned of \"fire and fury\" that could wipe out Pyongyang. At the United Nations, he insulted North Korean leader Kim Jung Un as \"Little Rocket Man.\" Trump took to Twitter to suggest that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim's.\n\nThe anniversary of his inauguration coincided with a government shutdown, and he scoffed that Democrats \"wanted to give me a nice present.\"\n\nHe traveled overseas four times, upbraiding traditional American allies at NATO for not paying enough, basking in the flattery of Chinese President Xi Jinping and touching a mysterious, glowing orb with Saudi King Salman.\n\nHis responses to domestic tragedies were uneven.\n\nHe paid tribute to the 58 victims of a shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas, but made no effort to toughen gun control laws. When Hurricane Maria crushed Puerto Rico, leaving half the island without power for months, Mr. Trump feuded with a local mayor and, during a visit, distributed paper towels to survivors by shooting them like they were basketballs.\n\nBefitting a man whose reality show ended with a firing each week, in Mr. Trump's first year his administration's upper-level officials have had a turnover rate of 34 percent, much higher than any other in the past 40 years. Gone were chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer and, after just 11 eventful days, communications director Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nBut the circumstances of two exits above all may define not just Mr. Trump's first year in office, but those to follow.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Flynn was fired less than a month into the term for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with foreign officials. In May, Mr. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the investigation into possible collusion between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\nThat dismissal led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose probe into possible collusion and obstruction of justice has hovered over the White House. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and is now cooperating with Mueller. Mr. Trump himself may at some point be interviewed.\n\n\"We've never had a president who had such a chaotic first year. Every day is topsy-turvy and disorganized, the country has not been so divided since the Civil War and Trump thrives at being the bull that carries his own china shop around with him,\" said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian at Rice University. \"He's not like anything we've seen before and this is the question: What are the consequences going to be?\"", "title": "The wild drama of Trump's first year", "sourceId": "cbs-news", "sourceName": "CBS News", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-first-year-filled-with-drama/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:38:55Z"}, {"textData": "Washington (CNN) Several members of Congress have asked that their pay be withheld during the government shutdown, with some saying they will donate that money to charity.\n\nRep.

During the government shutdown of 2013 , Delaney donated his salary to the same organization.\n\nDelaney is the first Democrat to announce his candidacy for the 2020 presidential race.

Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican leading the committee's Russia investigation, said Friday evening that the committee would consider using the rule \u2014 which he believed had never been invoked in the committee's 40-year history \u2014 in order to publicly release the memo that Republicans say details FBI abuses of a surveillance law known as FISA. And if the committee votes in favor of making the classified Nunes memo public, the rule states that it's then up to President Donald Trump to decide whether it should be released.\n\nRepublicans allege in the memo details FBI abuses related to FISA and the use of the opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia that was compiled by ex-British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, whose work with Fusion GPS was paid through Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nNunes' memo concludes that the FISA judge who signed off on surveillance warrants for members of Trump's team during the campaign was not given full information about the dossier that was used in at least one application, according to sources familiar with the document. One source said the judge was not told that the document was paid for by the Democratic sources. CNN first reported last April that the dossier was used as part of the justification with the secret FISA court to monitor the communications of former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The New York Times first reported on the charges outlined in Nunes' memo.\n\nBut Democrats say it's no more than Republican talking points that skew the underlying intelligence and is intended to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump's team and Russia.\n\nConaway said that the committee could act as early as the first week the House is back in session, once the panel's Republicans had a \"good family conversation\" with the broader conference about taking that step.\n\n\"The parliamentarian is dusting this one off, because I don't think there's been a vote,\" Conaway said. \"Back in the original formation they thought every once in a while, I think the phrase was 'grave public interest,' they foresaw there just might be some reason that the committee would need to override the classification system.\"\n\nBut there is disagreement within the Republican conference about not redacting the document first, with some Republicans expressing concerns about releasing sensitive intelligence information.\n\n\"It couldn't be released as it is for several reasons,\" said Rep. Pete King, a New York Republican on the Intelligence Committee. \"One, there's sources and methods in there. Secondly, part of it could interfere with an investigation. But I think parts of it could be redacted and released.\"\n\nConaway had a different view, however, saying the underlying intelligence that the memo was based on could not be released, but he was comfortable with publicizing the classified information Nunes cited. He didn't agree with King that sources and methods would be revealed.\n\n\"There's classified information in there, but there's not sources in methods. So I think it needs to be released,\" Conaway said.\n\nBut releasing the memo without the intelligence that it's based on is one of several issues raised by Democrats on the committee, who are still steaming over the abrupt vote the panel took Thursday to allow all House members to view Nunes' memo. The committee's nine Democrats issued a joint statement arguing that if the memo is released publicly, they won't be able to explain why it's inaccurate and flawed because the underlying intelligence will remain classified.\n\n\"Yesterday, HPSCI Republicans voted to make available to any Member of the House a misleading set of talking points attacking the FBI,\" the Democrats said. \"They did so as a prelude to seeking the talking points' public release -- for the political purpose of spreading a false narrative and undermining legitimate investigations.\"\n\nNunes fought the FBI and Department of Justice for months over documents related to the FBI's use of the opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia, threatening contempt of Congress to top officials until he got the documents he was seeking.\n\nWhile Republicans say the dossier was a politically motivated document, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson has testified that Steele went to the FBI out of national security concerns and that no one had instructed him to do so.\n\nThe committee rule that Republicans might rely on to release the memo states that the Intelligence Committee \"may disclose publicly any information in its possession after a determination by the select committee that the public interest would be served by such disclosure.\"\n\nUnder the rule, the committee vote would trigger a five-day waiting period where the President has to notify the committee whether he objects to the disclosure of the information.\n\nIf the President does not object, the information would be released. But if the President does object, it would put the matter to the full House, which could potentially debate the matter in a closed session in the chamber before a public vote could override the President's objection.\n\nSuch a decision for the President could drive yet another wedge between Trump and the intelligence community, the FBI and the Justice Department, all of which almost surely would object to the release of information related to FISA warrants.\n\nTrump has railed against the dossier and the Russia investigations, and claimed last year that he was wiretapped by the Obama administration. When Trump signed a FISA law renewing foreign surveillance measures on Friday, he noted the distinction.\n\n\"Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection,\" Trump tweeted. \"This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election.\"", "title": "How the House Intelligence Committee can make Nunes' FISA memo public", "sourceId": "cnn", "sourceName": "CNN", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/20/politics/house-intelligence-nunes-fisa-memo/index.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:32:17Z"}, {"textData": "", "title": "Six More Years of Surveillance", "sourceId": "fortune", "sourceName": "Fortune", "url": "http://fortune.com/2018/01/20/six-more-years-of-surveillance/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:31:35Z"}, {"textData": "Ramallah, occupied West Bank - Amid an ever-shrinking space for dissenting Palestinian voices, a new initiative sets out to recover some of the ground lost online.\n\nSada Social, a group launched in September by three Palestinian journalists, aims to document \"violations against Palestinian content\" on social networks such as Facebook and YouTube, and to liaise with its executives to restore some of the pages and accounts that have been shut down.\n\nWhile social media platforms do not take down content for overtly political reasons, they do strike down what is considered \"hate speech\" or incitement to violence, as well as other forms of online abuse that anyone can report.\n\nBut Palestinian journalists, activists and those behind Sada Social say there is a double standard regarding the enforcement of platforms' policies.\n\n\"There is a very big gap between Palestinians and Israelis,\" Sada Social cofounder Iyad Alrefaie told Al Jazeera, explaining that the idea for such an initiative stems from what he sees as an imbalance in the way social networks deal with censorship in the Israeli-Palestinian context.\n\n\"[Nothing happens] to Israelis who publish a status calling for killing Palestinians,\" he said. \"But if Palestinians post any news about something happening on the ground or done by an Israeli soldier, Facebook [may] close the account or the page, or delete the post.\"\n\nAccording to 7amleh, the Arab Center for Social Media Advancement, Israel has more than 200 criminal files against Arab and Palestinian activists charging them with incitement on the internet, while \"almost not a single case\" has been opened against Israeli instigators.\n\nAlrefaie edits a platform called Quds News Network, which uses 400 citizen journalists throughout the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip and occupied East Jerusalem and is popular with young Palestinians.\n\nLast summer, Quds Network was one of 30 critical media outlets to be shut down by the Palestinian Authority (PA) over accusations the organisations had ties to their political opponents.\n\nA year earlier, three of its executives had their accounts blocked by Facebook, while last autumn, the network's YouTube channel was suspended for allegedly violating \"community guidelines\" over a video showing Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades fighters during the 2014 Gaza war. The channel has yet to be restored.\n\nLast March, Facebook briefly shut down the page of Fatah, the party which dominates the PA, after it published an old photograph of late leader Yasser Arafat holding a rifle.\n\nA political satire page critical of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) called Mish Eek has been shut down and reopened several times.\n\n\"I think every Palestinian user or platform on social media will think twice before publishing anything,\" said Alrefaie.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nAlrefaie said he recorded at least 30 violations in the space of a week immediately after Trump's December 6 declaration recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, compared with 18 throughout October - including the accounts of journalists, activists or blogs that were shut down.\n\nHe estimates that 90 percent of cases concern Facebook, which remains the most popular platform among Palestinians.\n\nConcerns similar to those Sada Social is trying to address were expressed by an audience of human rights activists, journalists and civil society organisations who attended the \"Palestine Digital Activism Forum\" this week in Ramallah.\n\nIt brought together representatives from Palestinian and international human rights groups, government and social media companies, including Facebook.\n\nThe latter received a barrage of questions from the audience about its role in censoring Palestinian voices online and sharing information with the Israeli government, given that hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested in recent years over Facebook posts.\n\nCorporate complicity\n\nThe Israeli government, which often blames online incitement for flare-ups of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, has set up a specific unit to fight online crime.\n\nIn September 2016, a Facebook delegation met Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan - who spearheads the fight against the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement - with the aim of improving \"cooperation against incitement to terror and murder\", according to a statement released by the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office at the time.\n\nPalestinians pointed out that the social media giant was succumbing to pressure from the Israeli government to suppress the Palestinian narrative and was adopting the occupiers' definition of what incitement is.\n\nA report published in September 2017 by the Israeli Ministry of Justice said its cyber unit handled 2,241 cases of online content and succeeded in getting 70 percent of it removed.\n\nFacebook says it removes content that is considered illegal under local law, or that breaches its own \"community standards\", including hate speech towards a particular group.\n\n\"We engage all over the world with governments, NGOs, academics. It doesn't mean we take a position,\" a Facebook representative, Aibhinn Kelleher, said in response to a questions from the audience at the Ramallah forum.\n\n\"When it comes to the Israeli government having special treatment, that is not the case.\" Information-sharing, Kelleher added, only happens in the context of law enforcement.\n\nBut critics point out that what happens in the Israeli social media has attracted much less attention from both Facebook and the Israeli government.\n\nAccording to 7amleh, a racist post is published by Israelis against Arabs or Palestinians every 46 seconds.\n\n\"It's about the governments who are powerful. And if you come to the Israelis and tell them we have here a market of few hundreds millions of shekels that you are benefiting [from], obviously you have a leverage. Adding to the money, it's also about the hi-tech industry in Israel [and how] powerful [it is],\" said 7amleh director Nadim Nashif, who organised the Ramallah conference to highlight some of the issues facing Palestinian online activism, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Facebook is at the higher levels very much coordinated with Israeli politicians.\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Facebook's head of policy and communications in Israel, Jordana Cutler, said that the network works \"very closely with the cyber departments in the justice ministry and the police and with other elements in the army and the Shin Bet\".\n\nCutler was formerly a senior adviser to Netanyahu. Unit 8200, the Israeli army's cyber spy agency, is tasked with monitoring social media and other forms of electronic communication in order to prevent potential attacks.\n\nAll-round crackdown\n\nMahmoud Hassan, a lawyer for prisoners' rights group Addameer, noted at the forum that the organisation documented more than 300 cases of Palestinians arrested by Israel over Facebook posts in 2017.\n\nHe said that as Israel bans protests and considers Palestinian political parties as \"terrorist\" organisations, the definition of \"incitement\" and \"support for terrorism\" can be quite broad.\n\nOne of the charges against Nariman Tamimi, the mother of Ahed, a 16-year-old activist jailed for slapping a soldier in her village of Nabi Saleh, is live-streaming the video of the incident on Facebook.\n\nDereen Tatour, a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship, was notoriously arrested for her writings on Facebook, including a poem titled: \"Resist my people, resist\".\n\nPalestinian authorities have also moved to regulate the internet and the social media space.\n\nLast July, the PA passed the Electronic Crimes Law by presidential decree, citing the need to close some loopholes to prevent fraud.\n\nThe law, described as \"draconian\" by human rights groups across the board, severely impinged on individual freedom of expression, privacy and media freedom.\n\nLast September, the PA arrested the head of a radio station in Hebron, Ayman Qawasmeh, just days after Israeli forces had raided the studio and shut it down.\n\nWhen the well-known human rights defender Issa Amro criticised what happened on his Facebook status, he too was arrested by the PA.\n\nUnder international pressure, Palestinians have now proposed another version of the law, which no longer includes broad language allowing online critics of the authorities to be imprisoned or fined for violations such as \"endangering public order\".\n\nThe proposed version still allows for websites to be blocked without a court order if they publish \"material that may threaten national security, civil peace, public order and public morals\".\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n\"Even if it is adopted, it still falls short of international standards,\" Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera.\n\nShakir also pointed out that the PA's campaign against critical voices predates the passing of the law. And in Gaza, Hamas has carried out arrests and interrogations on grounds of \"misuse of technology.\"\n\n\"Human Rights Watch has documented cases where Palestinians have been detained by both the PA and Israel,\" he said.\n\n\"We have seen certain sites and outlets that had a ban on the Palestinian side, and were then shut down on the Israeli side,\" he added.\n\n\"We've see numerous cases that suggest there is close coordination when it comes to not only security, but also shutting down the space for free expression.\"", "title": "Palestinians fight Facebook, YouTube censorship", "sourceId": "al-jazeera-english", "sourceName": "Al Jazeera English", "url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/palestinians-fight-facebook-youtube-censorship-180119095053943.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:31:30Z"}, {"textData": "Officials made the most recent discovery\u00a0near the municipality of Viescas in the southwestern part of the state, information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Coahuila Attorney General\u2019s Office revealed.

Active military, reserve and national guard members will only be paid for money earned before Jan. 20, according to the Pentagon.\n\nAny deal to restore funding and reopen the government would almost assuredly include back pay for troops, meaning they wouldn\u2019t see any pay cut if the shutdown is resolved within days.

Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican who is retiring, was equally blunt in a Friday interview.\n\u201cIf there is a shutdown I suspect that we Republicans, since we control all three branches of government, will be blamed \u2013 whether we deserve it or not,\u201d he said.\nYet the shutdown could be disruptive for Republicans in other ways. The failure to keep the government open, party strategists worry, threatens to distract from their successful tax reform push \u2013 a long-sought Trump legislative accomplishment. Republican officials had hoped to turn the tax bill into a centerpiece of the 2018 campaign, so much so that during a recent political briefing with the president at Camp David, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy stressed the need to highlight the benefits of the legislation. \n\u201cWe will be squandering any good will that\u2019s starting to formulate as a result of tax reform,\u201d said Robert Blizzard, a veteran GOP pollster who is advising a number of congressional candidates.\nYet the impact of a federal shutdown can be hard to predict. It was widely expected that Republicans would face serious political repercussions when the government last shut down in 2013. Instead, they went on to seize control of the Senate and win the largest House majority since the Herbert Hoover presidency.\nSome Republicans see potential political benefit to the shutdown, arguing that it could upend the political landscape and put newfound pressure on Democratic senators from conservative states up for reelection. Republicans are preparing to cast them as soft on immigration, charging that they refused to vote for the bill because they favored illegal immigrants over funding the military and children\u2019s insurance programs. Democrats objected to the proposed government funding bill because it did not include protections for recipients of DACA, which expires in March.\nA daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.\nBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But even those who are convinced the 2014 midterm results prove voters won't punish the party held responsible believe there\u2019s a slim chance this time may be different. Widespread discontent with Trump and the Republican Party\u2019s total control of government, they argue, makes this shutdown different. \n\u201cThe [2013] shutdown was bad for the GOP in the moment, but larger trends overcame the hit they took,\u201d said David Axelrod, a longtime top adviser to former President Barack Obama.\n\u201cWhat is different here is that they now have a president, and he will define the fall election, and a shutdown should amplify concerns many already share,\u201d he added. \u201cIf he is viewed as a source of chaos and dysfunction, it will be a burden the Republicans will carry into November.\u201d\n\nCongress\n\n            By BURGESS EVERETT, RACHAEL BADE, ELIANA JOHNSON and SEUNG MIN KIM\nDemocrats spent much of the week laying the groundwork for a blame-Trump campaign. The Democratic National Committee, for instance, circulated a talking points document to surrogates, lawmakers, staff and elected officials. \n\u201cRepublicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. Any government shutdown falls 100% on the Republican Party, the party in power,\u201d read the memo. \u201cAt no point in this country\u2019s history have we ever seen one party control all the levels [and] branches of government and still fail to do their basic job of keeping the government open.\u201d\nThe memo proposes using the shutdown to establish a broader narrative that \u201cthis is Trump\u2019s Republican Party: Chaos, incompetence, and destruction.\u201d\nAnd on Friday morning, American Bridge, the party\u2019s leading opposition research super PAC, held an hour-long strategy session to figure out how to spin the short-term blame game into longer-term message that could be used in this year\u2019s races for the midterms. The group decided to prepare a round of digital ads attacking Republicans including Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who is facing a treacherous path to reelection.\nStill unclear, however, is whether voters will remember the shutdown when they head to the polls in November. The answer is likely depend on a variety of factors, such as how long the shutdown lasts, how the markets react, and how it\u2019s resolved.\n\"Nobody will remember this if we get a good outcome,\" said Graham.\n\n                                            By Janine di Giovanni\n\n                                            By Dan Diamond\n\n                                            By Jeff Greenfield\n\n                                            By Gordon F.

But he accused the President of walking back on an agreement under pressure from right-wing members of his own administration.\n\nBut White House budget director Mick Mulvaney disputed the claim that Schumer's offer met Trump's demands\n\n\"Mr. Schumer has to up his game and be more honest with the President of the United States if we are going to be seeing progress,\" he said.\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nThe dramatic shutdown marked the finale of a game of chicken that's been waged for months between Republicans and Democrats. While budget negotiations have worked through a number of sticking points, including domestic versus defense spending caps, children's health insurance and disaster relief, both sides have dug in deeper over immigration -- convinced the other side would blink..\n\nFor Republicans, it was essential to isolate immigration as an issue, with the hope of gaining more leverage by dragging it closer to a March deadline on DACA and forcing Democrats to give up their budget negotiating power in fear of the ramifications of a shutdown perceived as just about immigration.\n\nFor Democrats, the focus was on keeping immigration as part of the fabric of issues, showing the base it wasn't an issue that could be jettisoned for convenience and maintaining negotiating leverage.\n\nBoth sides were convinced for months their side was the stronger position.\n\nBut at the deadline, neither blinked.\n\nBlame game\n\nHouse Republicans were emphatic: This one isn't their fault.\n\n\"It's the hashtag Schumer Shutdown. Period,\" Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri.\n\nStill, members were irritated Saturday morning as they gathered for their morning conference meeting. California Republican Darrell Issa described the mood as \"not good.\"\n\nDuring a Republican conference meeting, Long told reporters that Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri told her fellow members about how she had a new 2-day-old grandchild she was ready to see and that she was worried about the military not getting their paychecks.\n\nModerate New Jersey Republican Tom MacArthur blasted: \"I think this is extremely irresponsible.\"\n\nRepublicans feel confident that they're on the right side of the shutdown. While House Republicans were the ones who failed to deliver the votes when the government shut down in 2013, this time around members say they want their leadership to stand firm against Senate Democrats who they believe will feel the pressure sooner or later.", "title": "Lawmakers scramble for a deal amid shutdown-DACA 'chaos'", "sourceId": "cnn", "sourceName": "CNN", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/20/politics/government-shutdown-daca-deal-developments/index.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:17:15Z"}, {"textData": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSessions: 'We should be like Canada' in how we take in immigrants NSA spying program overcomes key Senate hurdle Overnight Finance: Lawmakers see shutdown odds rising | Trump calls for looser rules for bank loans | Consumer bureau moves to revise payday lending rule | Trump warns China on trade deficit MORE (R-Ky.) called on Democrats Saturday to reopen the federal government and resume negotiations on immigration, spending caps and children\u2019s health funding.\n\u201cI would invite all of my colleagues across the aisle to join together and do what is obviously responsible,\u201d he said on the Senate floor, shortly after the chamber convened for the first day of the shutdown.\n\u201cLet\u2019s resume the bipartisan discussion on funding, our troops, DACA, on government spending and all of the other priorities that all of us can work together to resolve,\u201d he said, referring to the\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that President TrumpDonald John TrumpDems flip Wisconsin state Senate seat Sessions: 'We should be like Canada' in how we take in immigrants GOP rep: 'Sheet metal and garbage' everywhere in Haiti  MORE rescinded in September, which leaves hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children potentially facing deportation.\n\nMcConnell has called on Democrats to pass a three-week funding measure to reopen the government and keep federal agencies running until Feb. 8.

Her tenure is the third shortest since the mid-1930s. Most of her predecessors served for far longer periods. (Nov. 2) AP\n\nJohn Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, says the economy could grow faster than anticipated in 2018. (Photo: John Williams)\n\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams says significant risks to the economy have faded for the first time since the recession and stronger growth could force the Fed to raise interest rates more rapidly than anticipated.\n\nIn an interview, Williams, who Trump is considering as vice chairman of the Fed's board, said he\u2019s comfortable with Fed policymakers\u2019 median forecast of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018. But he believes there\u2019s a greater chance of faster growth and inflation prompting four rate increases than of slower gains forcing a pullback to two bumps.\n\n\u201cThere is some potential the economy is going to outperform my forecast,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not really worried about the economy stalling, which was a concern a few years ago.\u201d\n\nMore: How the Fed interest rate hike could affect your wallet\n\nMore: Fed raises rates, keeps forecast for 3 hikes in 2018\n\nMore: Tax cuts: Economists see modest impact on workers, economy as corporate taxes fall\n\nBarring a downturn in the economy\u2019s performance over the next two months, he said it appears likely the Fed will raise its benchmark short-term rate in March, as markets anticipate, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. But he stressed that economic data in coming weeks will guide the Fed\u2019s decision.\n\nWilliams also said he believes the tax cuts signed into law by President Trump last month will boost the economy modestly and won\u2019t crimp growth in a couple of years by swelling the deficit and pushing up borrowing costs. That sanguine view contrasts with many economists\u2019 forecasts that the tax overhaul will serve as a drag on growth as soon as 2020.\n\nWilliams\u2019 outlook is noteworthy not only because he may take the Fed's No 2. role. He\u2019s also considered a centrist who has voted in lockstep with both outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen, a Democrat, and Republican Fed Governor Jerome Powell. Powell is scheduled to take the Fed\u2019s reins from Yellen next month after his expected Senate confirmation. Williams, who was Yellen\u2019s research director when she headed the San Francisco Fed, will be a voting member of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee this year.\n\nNot long ago, Fed officials worried that hiking rates at even a moderate pace could derail a fragile recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. But Williams cited the current confluence of positive economic forces, including a resurgent global economy, strong consumer and business confidence, record stock prices and the Republican tax cuts.\n\n\u201cI think the economy has very solid momentum,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeed bumps ahead?\n\nNot that the economy doesn\u2019t face speed bumps that continue to restrain growth. Those include vestiges of the recession, such as cautious lenders, fewer business startups and millions of prime-age men who remain outside the labor force. Those scars are \u201cprobably going to be with us for the foreseeable future,\u201d Williams said. He also highlights long-term challenges such as an aging population and sluggish gains in productivity, or worker output.\n\nThe tax cuts, he projects, will result in \u201ca little bit faster\u201d growth, adding about a quarter percentage point a year for the next three years, largely by spurring businesses to increase investment and become more productive. By lowering individual tax rates, he said the plan also could draw some Americans back into the workforce, adding as much as another percentage point to economic output over a decade.\n\nStill, Williams said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need a stimulus right now in terms of short-run growth.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he disagrees with economists who believe the benefits of the tax overhaul will be offset by a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion rise in the federal deficit that will drive up long-term interest rates and discourage borrowing and economic activity.\n\n\u201cBecause of the size of the tax cuts, there's not going to be dramatically higher interest rates,\u201d he says. He expects the added debt will increase long-term rates by about a quarter percentage point over the next few years. Williams forecasts economic growth of about 2.5% both in 2017 and this year, 2% in 2019 and a slowdown to 1\u00be% over five years. The economy has expanded at a tepid 2.1% average pace during the recovery. Trump has vowed his agenda of lower taxes and fewer regulations will deliver 3% growth.\n\nWilliams also downplays fears that the economic stimulus from the tax overhaul will lead to an excessive run-up in wage growth and inflation, especially with the 4.1% unemployment rate already sparking worker shortages. He points to long-term factors that have suppressed consumer price increases, such as slower-growing health care costs due to reduced government spending on Medicare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really worried about inflation taking off,\u201d he says.\n\nSlow wage growth, inflation\n\nIn fact, many economists have been puzzled that average annual wage growth has been stuck at about 2.5% the past couple of years despite the low jobless rate. But Williams said it wasn\u2019t until last year that the economy strengthened and unemployment fell below a normal 4.7%, increasing the competition for workers.\n\n\u201c I expect upward pressure on wages to really show up in 2018 and 2019,\u201d he said. He foresees pay increases approaching 3% by the end of the year.\n\nThat, he says, should help nudge the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of annual inflation from 1.5% toward its 2% target over the next two years. Williams is among Fed officials who have recently argued the central bank should consider letting inflation exceed its 2% benchmark for a period to make up for undershoots during and after the recession.\n\nYet while he isn\u2019t worried about a spike in inflation in the near term, he says gradual rate hikes \u201cwould be the right thing to do\u201d to ward off such a scenario. \u201cI think that waiting too long could actually create some risk down the road that the economy does overheat,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to see this expansion continue as long as possible.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump's pick to head the Federal Reserve, is casting himself as a figure of stability and continuity, praising former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke.

He wants to build a stupidly expensive, unnecessary wall to keep out Mexicans and Central Americans. And under Trump, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ramped up its efforts to kick out immigrants who have spent the vast majority of their lives here.\nIt gets worse.\u00a0\nJust this month, Trump reportedly described Haiti and African countries as \u201cshithole countries\u201d in a closed Oval Office meeting. He instead suggested the U.S. bring in immigrants from nations like Norway.\nBut nothing quite shows the disdain he has for immigrants in this nation like his handling of Dreamers, unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and who know no other home. Last September, Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), originally put in place by former President Barack Obama, which protected these young immigrants from deportation.\u00a0\nDemocratic lawmakers have made it clear that they won\u2019t support the policy many say is racist. Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, used\u00a0immigrant lives as a bargaining chip for the government shutdown, which occurred after Congress was unable to reach a budget agreement by midnight on Friday.\n#Senate\u00a0Democrats have a choice to make.

Banh was initially somewhat skeptical that the man actually had worms, but his curiosity was piqued when he saw a small plastic bag next to the patient.\nWhen he asked the patient about it, he was told, \u201cIt\u2019s the worm,\u201d Banh recalled on the podcast.\n\u201cI open it up and I take out a toilet paper roll ... and wrapped around it is of course this giant, long, what looks like a flat tapeworm,\u201d said Banh.\nin other news:https://t.co/BDsMxCXhrr\u2014 Cara Maria (@CaraMariaMTV) January 20, 2018\n\n\nThe patient reported that he had abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea before seeing part of the worm hanging out of his body while on the toilet, Banh said. He started pulling on the long, stringy item until it was all the way out.\n\u201cAnd what does it do? It starts moving,\u201d said Banh.\nThe patient was actually relieved that it was a tapeworm \u2015 a parasite that can grow in the digestive tract \u2015 and not his organs spilling out of his body. But he was understandably curious about where the worm came from.\nBanh said that when he questioned the man about possible risk factors \u2014 like whether he had traveled to any developing countries, whether he had been drinking well water \u2014 only one detail stood out as a likely explanation. The man said he absolutely loved sushi and consumed raw salmon \u201calmost every day,\u201d Banh recalled.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\u00a0the most common tapeworm to infect humans is Diphyllobothrium latum. People become infected after eating certain types of raw or undercooked fish, including salmon. And The Washington Post notes that salmon from the Pacific coasts of Asia and North America can be infected with a type of tapeworm known as Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense.\nProperly cooking the fish \u2014 or, in the case of sushi, flash-freezing it at a low enough temperature \u2014 kills these worms. The CDC notes that most cases are asymptomatic, though infection can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and even vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia.\nBanh\u00a0told ABC30\u00a0that the worm had most likely been growing inside the man\u2019s body for about six months. And the man had eaten sushi at so many different places, it would be impossible to figure out which location was responsible.\nThe good news is, getting rid of an infection is easy and only takes one dose of a deworming medication. Even so, Banh told Post that the patient \u201cswore off sushi\u201d \u2014 at least for now.", "title": "Sushi Fanatic Rethinks Raw Fish After Pulling 5-Foot Tapeworm From Body", "sourceId": "the-huffington-post", "sourceName": "The Huffington Post", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sushi-tapeworm-fresno_us_5a637b87e4b002283003341b", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T18:59:40Z"}, {"textData": "President Donald Trump and his party are likely to bear the brunt of public blowback for the shutdown, three polls released in the runup to the event all suggest.\nBut how pollsters ask about the situation matters. And using recent history as a guide, there\u2019s good reason to suspect that any blowback from a shutdown could wear off long before November.\nAmericans said by a 20-point margin, 48 percent to 28 percent, that President Trump and Republicans would be more to blame than Democrats for the impending threat of a shutdown, in a\u00a0Washington Post/ABC News poll released Friday. Nearly 80 percent of Democrats put the blame on the president and his party, while a smaller two-thirds majority of Republicans cast the blame on the Democrats.\nA\u00a0Quinnipiac poll out earlier in the week, which separated out Trump from the congressional GOP,\u00a0found that 32 percent of voters would blame Republicans in Congress, 34 percent would blame Democrats in Congress, and another 21 percent would blame Trump.\u00a0And a\u00a0third survey from CNN and the polling firm SSRS, released Friday, which also asked a three-way blame question found that 31 percent would place the most responsibility on congressional Democrats, 26 percent would place it on congressional Republicans, and 21 percent would assign it most to Trump (a tenth volunteered that they\u2019d blame everyone).\u00a0\nIn both cases, that works out to a plurality of blame focused on Trump and the GOP,\u00a0even if the Democrats don\u2019t emerge entirely unscathed.\nBut the CNN/SSRS poll also posed another question with a very different framing, asking respondents to choose whether it was more important for Congress to \u201c[approve]\u00a0a budget agreement that would avoid a government shutdown\u201d or to \u201c[pass] legislation to maintain the program which allows immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain in the U.S.\u201d\nIn response, Americans prioritized keeping the government open, 56 percent to 34 percents. Even Democrats were relatively divided, with 49 percent more concerned about the DACA program, but 42 percent more worried about a shutdown. Republicans and independents overwhelmingly said avoiding a shutdown was more important.\nNone of these questions are inherently better or worse ways of looking at the shutdown. But the discrepancy between the responses underlines how much it matters what frame Americans will use to think about the shutdown when they\u2019re not being directly asked by pollsters \u2015 or how much they\u2019ll be thinking about it at all.\nThat\u2019s especially challenging to gauge based on polls conducted before the shutdown, which required Americans to hypothetically assign blame for an event that hadn\u2019t yet happened. And a lot will depend on both parties\u2019 messaging in the days to come, as well as the length of the shutdown and the degree of tangible effects to come out of it.\nStill, it\u2019s not a stretch to suggest that a high-profile bout of government turmoil isn\u2019t likely to do much good for the party that controls the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. If that holds true,\u00a0it could stem what appeared to be a modest recent improvement for the GOP in\u00a0voter preference polls ahead of this year\u2019s congressional election, a measure in which they\u2019re still currently lagging.\nBut Democrats hoping a shutdown would saddle the opposition in this year\u2019s midterms should take a cautionary note from the shutdown in 2013 under the Obama administration.\u00a0The GOP, which only controlled the House of Representatives at the time,\u00a0also took the blame, causing an\u00a0immediate, damaging effect\u00a0on the party\u2019s image, which plunged to a record low.\nThat effect, however, wore off long before Election Day 2014, when the Republicans saw sweeping gains.\nPolling from that election cycle shows this in action \u2015 the public\u2019s preference for a Democratic candidate over a Republican one spiked sharply as the specter of a shutdown loomed in fall 2013, but receded almost entirely in October and November, returning to the status quo less than three months later.\u00a0\n\nThere are a few differences this time around. Election Day is a little closer for one thing, and, Republicans\u2019 control of the government may make it harder for them to disperse the blame. Democrats are starting from a far stronger electoral position in these midterms than they were in four years ago. But it\u2019s far from clear that the shutdown will have much to lend to their arsenal by November.\nThe Washington Post/ABC News poll was conducted Jan. 15-18 among 1,005 adults, while the CNN/SSRS poll was conducted Jan. 14-18 among 1,005 adults, and the Quinnipiac poll surveyed 1,212 registered voters between Jan. 12-16.

It was an outward display of a mindset that in many ways has paved the way for the government shutdown we\u2019re facing now.\nLast week, NBC News reported that last fall, the president of the United States\u00a0asked a career intelligence analyst \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d She responded, \u201cNew York,\u201d and that should have ended the conversation. It didn\u2019t. \nHe asked again, and she responded, \u201cManhattan.\u201d\nFor those who have initiated a similar conversation, if you ask twice and you don\u2019t get the answer you are fishing for \u2015 just drop it. Take a hint. We don\u2019t want to go there with you.\nTrump, clearly oblivious to this social cue, follows up and asks where \u201cyour people\u201d are from. \nFinally relenting, the analyst answered that her parents are Korean. At this point, Trump, through his ignorance, has robbed this woman of all the hard work, intellect and skill she has invested into her profession by placing some artificial value on her (and her family\u2019s) ethnicity. \nWhere she or her parents are from has zero bearing on her job or value. It\u2019s one thing if someone volunteers information about their culture, background, family and upbringing. But until they do, it\u2019s none of your business and should have no role in how you judge, evaluate and view them as professionals or human beings.\nTaking it even further, Trump somehow manages to combine sexism with racism by asking why the \u201cpretty Korean lady\u201d wasn\u2019t negotiating with North Korea. The insane thing about this statement is that I\u2019m 100 percent certain that in Trump\u2019s mind, he was paying her a compliment.\nWhat he did was demean and insult a woman who was simply trying to do her job.\nTrump owes this \u201cpretty Korean lady\u201d an apology for his ignorant, racist and sexist comments. I don\u2019t think Trump realizes or cares about the consequences that his tone, tenor and words have had in the lives of people who don\u2019t look like him.\nPretty much my entire life, I\u2019ve been asked (primarily by white people) the question that I imagine every \u201cAsian-looking\u201d person cringes at inside: \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \nIn most cases, I\u2019m certain that the person asking this is not consciously discriminatory, but rather is just completely ignorant of how annoying this question is to people who look like me. Like the career intelligence analyst attempted to do with Trump, I answered the question by saying \u201cNew York\u201d or \u201cCalifornia\u201d \u2015 where I had spent my childhood and formative years. Inevitably comes the dreaded follow-up: \u201cNo, I mean what is your background? Chinese or Japanese?\u201d \nThe puzzled looks I would receive when I responded: \u201cGerman and Italian\u201d were priceless but also revealing. I simply did not fit into their preordained stereotypical worldviews. \nMy name is Kurt (German) Bardella (Italian), and I am adopted.\nFor most of you out there who ask this question of people who look or sound \u201cdifferent,\u201d you\u2019re probably just genuinely curious and mean no harm. You\u2019re just trying to start conversation.\nBut the case of Trump and the career intelligence professional reveals something much more offensive. It was a glimpse into the racially charged worldview that Trump subscribes to,\u00a0a worldview that has infected the Republican Party and now led us to a government shutdown.\nIt\u2019s the same worldview that led to his vulgarly demeaning the lives of would-be immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and nations in Africa. It\u2019s the same worldview that has him obsessed with building a border wall to keep \u201cbad hombres\u201d out of the United States. And it\u2019s the same worldview that drove him to end DACA.\nTrump and his Republican enablers are so fixated on enacting these outwardly racist policies that they are willing to preside over a government shutdown to get them. \nThe shutdown showdown unfolding right now is about much more than government funding.\u00a0It is about two different portraits representing the American identity. The Trump-GOP viewpoint sees our country as one that is, first and foremost, Caucasian. The Democratic perspective sees a diverse nation of many cultures, backgrounds, languages and customs.\nThat\u2019s what we are fighting about. It may be more politically expedient for Democrats to back down, but with our national identity hanging in the balance, this is the time to take a stand. \u00a0\nKurt Bardella was born in Seoul, South Korea, and adopted by two Americans from Rochester, New York, when he was three months old.

We are indebted to him for them.\u201d\n\nPaul Bocuse was born on Feb. 11, 1926, in Collonges-au-Mont-d\u2019Or, where his forebears had been cooking and serving food for seven generations. At the age of 8, he made his first serious dish, veal kidneys with pur\u00e9ed potatoes, and as a teenager he began an apprenticeship at a local restaurant. The training was interrupted by World War II, however, when he was assigned to a Vichy government youth camp and put to work in its canteen and slaughterhouse. In 1944, he joined the 1st Free French Division and was wounded in combat in Alsace. He received the Croix de Guerre.\n\nAfter the war, he resumed his apprenticeship at the restaurant, La M\u00e8re Brazier in Le Col de la Lu\u00e8re, outside Lyon. Like its twin in Lyon, it was owned by the legendary Eug\u00e9nie Brazier and had achieved three Michelin stars by serving impeccable renditions of regional classics.\n\nAfter a brief stint at the three-star Lucas Carton in Paris, where he worked alongside the brothers Pierre and Jean Troisgros, Mr. Bocuse spent eight years under Point at La Pyramide in Vienne, near Lyon. \u201cBack then a lot of restaurants were doing the same kind of old-fashioned Escoffier-style cooking, with lots of sauces hiding the ingredients, and the same dishes night after night,\u201d Mr. Bocuse told The New York Times in 2007. \u201cPoint was a perfectionist who gave value and credibility to the finest ingredients.\u201d\n\nIn 1956, Mr. Bocuse returned to the family restaurant, the Auberge du Pont de Collonges, which earned its first Michelin star two years later. Despite the paper tablecloths and stainless-steel cutlery, a second star was awarded in 1960.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1966, a year after the restaurant earned its third star, Mr. Bocuse bought back the old family restaurant that his grandfather, in straitened circumstances, had sold in 1921 along with the rights to the Bocuse name. He renamed the building, which once belonged to an order of monks, the Abbaye de Collonges and converted it into a banquet hall. He also hoisted a four-foot neon \u201cPaul Bocuse\u201d sign atop his restaurant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe groundswell for nouvelle cuisine transformed Mr. Bocuse into the international face of French cooking. He appeared on the cover of The New York Times Magazine in 1972. In 1975, resplendent in chef whites and toque, he looked out from the cover of Newsweek under the banner headline \u201cFood: The New Wave.\u201d An apprenticeship at his restaurant became a rite of passage for ambitious chefs, including Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Daniel Boulud.\n\nIn time, as a backlash against nouvelle cuisine developed, Mr. Bocuse put some distance between himself and the movement. He referred snidely to \u201cmini-portions on maxi-plates\u201d and at one point dismissed the movement as \u201ca joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not true that Paul Bocuse invented Nouvelle Cuisine,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal in 2011. \u201cThere were a few dishes that were developed lighter, but that is normal in cooking. The term Nouvelle Cuisine as it came to be known was nothing to do with what was on the plate, but what was on the bill.\u201d\n\nNouvelle cuisine lost momentum, but Mr. Bocuse did not. In the early 1980s, the Walt Disney Company invited him to create restaurants for the French pavilion at Epcot Center (now Walt Disney World) in Orlando, Fla. With Gaston Len\u00f4tre and Roger Verg\u00e9, he developed Les Chefs de France restaurant, which is now operated by his son, J\u00e9r\u00f4me, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. It serves 2,000 meals a day and generates about $30 million a year.\n\nWhen the organizers of Eurexpo, a culinary trade fair in Lyon, approached Mr. Bocuse for ideas on how to promote the event, he proposed a cooking contest in which chefs would prepare two elaborate dishes, one fish and one meat, before a live audience and then submit them to a panel of expert judges for scoring. The Bocuse d\u2019Or, held every two years, made its debut in 1987 and is now regarded as the culinary equivalent of the Olympics, attracting teams from all over the world.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn addition to his restaurant in Collonges-au-Mont-d\u2019Or, Mr. Bocuse operated brasseries in France, Switzerland and Japan, and a culinary school at \u00c9cully, near Lyon.\n\nHis cookbooks include \u201cPaul Bocuse\u2019s French Cooking (1977), \u201cPaul Bocuse in Your Kitchen: An Introduction to Classic French Cooking\u201d (1982), \u201cBocuse \u00e0 la Carte\u201d (1989) and \u201cPaul Bocuse: The Complete Recipes\u201d (2011).\n\nFor many years, Mr. Bocuse resisted writing the story of his life, but he eventually worked with Eve-Marie Zizza-Lalu to produce an as-told-to memoir, \u201cPaul Bocuse: The Sacred Fire,\u201d published in 2005. Even in France, eyebrows lifted a little when Mr. Bocuse revealed that for more than 30 years, he had enjoyed the company of not only his wife, Raymonde, the mother of his daughter, Fran\u00e7oise Bernachon, but also of two mistresses, one of them the mother of J\u00e9r\u00f4me. His wife survives him, as do his two children.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt would not be everyone\u2019s idea of married life, but everyone gets on,\u201d he told The Daily Telegraph of London at the time. \u201cThey are all happy, with me and each other, and if I add up the time we have spent together as couples, it comes to 145 years.\u201d\n\nDespite his international status, Mr. Bocuse remained a chef deeply rooted in his native soil.

Kelly, his chief of staff, who is also a newcomer to high-stakes legislative talks, and is still learning to channel Mr. Trump\u2019s fluctuating impulses, to haggle over the details with Republican leaders, who have become accustomed to plunging into tricky negotiations without a clear sense of what the president would accept.\n\nMr. Trump shuttled between the presidential residence and the Oval Office, where he spent some time in the afternoon. Throughout the day, he monitored television coverage that toggled between the government shutdown and the women\u2019s marches, one of which ended near the White House.\n\nThe president spoke with the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, to discuss the impact of the shutdown on border security and the military. He met at the White House with Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and spoke by phone with the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, to strategize on a path forward.\n\nThe immediate cause of the shutdown, which began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday after Senate Democrats blocked consideration of a House-passed stopgap measure, was a dispute over spending. But it was a stalemate over immigration policy, the topic that propelled Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise and has dominated his first 12 months as president, that snarled the negotiations, as the president vacillated over what approach he should take and advisers including Mr. Kelly counseled a harder line.\n\nEager to strike a deal with Democrats to extend deportation reprieves to a group of undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, Mr. Trump was nonetheless constrained by his own campaign promises to toughen immigration restrictions, and hemmed in by Republican congressional leaders uneasy about lining up behind a mercurial president with a penchant for changing his mind.\n\nAs negotiators on Capitol Hill held out hope of a swift agreement that could end the impasse before the weekend was out, the House and the Senate reconvened for a rare Saturday session. The likeliest path to reopening the government is an agreement on a stopgap spending measure that would stretch longer than the few days that Senate Democrats wanted, but shorter than the four weeks that the House approved on Thursday night.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Saturday that the president refused to negotiate on immigration issues until there was a deal to reopen the government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReferring to Democrats\u2019 insistence that a deal to protect the young immigrants be in hand before they agree to a funding measure, Marc Short, the White House legislative director, told reporters at the White House: \u201cThere is nothing in this bill Democrats say they object to, yet it\u2019s like a 2-year-old temper tantrum to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to take my toys and go home because I\u2019m upset about something else.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his morning Twitter burst, Mr. Trump said Democrats were prioritizing \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d over American citizens and military personnel, and argued that the only solution to end the dysfunction was to defeat the party in this year\u2019s midterm congressional elections.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border,\u201d the president said on Twitter. \u201cThey could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!\u201d\n\nIn fact, it was Mr. Trump who opted not to pursue a potential deal that he and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, had hashed out over lunch at the White House on Friday. The proposal would have kept the government open, funded a border wall and extended legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while including disaster aid funds and money for a federal children\u2019s health insurance program. Mr. Kelly later called Mr. Schumer to say the agreement lacked sufficient immigration restrictions.\n\nWhile Mr. Schumer said shortly after the government shut down that \u201cin my heart, I thought we might have a deal tonight,\u201d White House officials argued that he had drastically overstated the progress made during the lunch.\n\nOn Saturday, though, Mr. Schumer said that even members of the president\u2019s party had by now recognized that Mr. Trump was ill equipped to strike a political compromise.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s even more frustrating than President Trump\u2019s intransigence is the way he seems amenable to these compromises before completely switching positions and backing off,\u201d he said on the Senate floor. \u201cNegotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O.\u201d\n\nThe remark echoed one made by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, at a hearing this past week, in which he said there were \u201ctwo Trumps,\u201d one who was open to a bipartisan immigration deal and one who was not.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s shifting desires and demands on immigration have complicated the task of resolving the shutdown conflict. He has repeatedly signaled an inclination to strike a deal with Democrats that would codify Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that gave work permits and deportation reprieves to about 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut each time he has drifted toward such a bargain \u2014 first at a dinner last year with Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, then at a large meeting in the Cabinet Room this month with lawmakers in both parties, next in phone conversations with Mr. Graham and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and again on Friday with Mr. Schumer \u2014 he has snapped back to a hard-line position.\n\nConservative Republican lawmakers and proponents of immigration restrictions in his inner circle at the White House, led by his senior adviser, Stephen Miller, and Mr. Kelly, have often been the ones to intervene, pushing the president to take a harder line.\n\nOne senior administration official, who asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations, described an inexperienced president who genuinely wanted to reach a deal with Mr. Schumer when he called the Democratic leader to the White House on Friday. But Mr. Trump had not determined how it would play out or mapped out a strategy with Republican leaders, the official said, or considered how the politics of a shutdown might unravel.\n\nAfter Mr. Schumer departed, Mr. Trump met at the White House with Representatives Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho, members of the conservative Freedom Caucus who insist that any DACA measure include steeper immigration restrictions than the president has demanded.\n\nYet Mr. Trump has complained privately about his own advisers\u2019 attempts to stiffen his spine on immigration. In the Cabinet Room meeting this month, the president erupted when an aide distributed a list of conditions that included restrictive interior enforcement measures. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is,\u201d the president said, according to a person briefed on the exchange, which was first reported by The Washington Post, and said he did not appreciate being blindsided by his own staff.\n\nA Trump adviser painted a different picture, saying that Mr. Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat, had expressed anger at the document, and that Mr. Trump, who often plays to the crowd in front of him, was merely joining in the outrage.\n\nOn Saturday, the president was left alternately defiant and angry, self-pitying and frustrated. He argued to aides that he did not deserve the blame he was taking, but without a credible deal on the table, there was little for him to do. Irritated to have missed his big event in Florida, Mr. Trump spent much of his day watching old TV clips of him berating President Barack Obama for a lack of leadership during the 2013 government shutdown, a White House aide said, seeming content to sit back and watch the show.", "title": "Trump Accuses Democrats of Playing \u2018Shutdown Politics\u2019 on Anniversary", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/us/politics/trump-shutdown.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T13:03:03Z"}, {"textData": "CLOSE The U.S. government shut down at midnight after Congress failed to resolve a partisan standoff over immigration and spending.

(Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe federal government partially shut down Saturday after the Senate blocked a short-term spending bill Friday night.\n\nNow, Congress is scrambling to come to an agreement while many federal agencies and departments have been forced to close on the one-year anniversary of President Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nHere's what you need to know today:\n\nTalks started again Saturday\n\nLawmakers went back to the Capitol at 9 a.m.\n\nWhat are they fighting about?\n\nA bitter spending-and-immigration impasse largely caused the shutdown.\n\nIn the Senate, there is one offer on the table that could lead to a breakthrough \u2014 a three-week spending bill with a promise to use that time to hash out an immigration deal and other contentious issues \u2014 but it's not clear whether Congress could pass such a bill.\n\nMore: The government shuts down after Senate blocks short-term spending bill\n\nWhat's different today\n\nOnly \u201cessential\u201d government employees will report to work, so most federal agencies and departments are closed for now.\n\nThe big difference this time around compared to the shutdown in 2013 is that monuments and parts of most national parks will remain open. Services that require staffing and maintenance, such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms, and concessions that require some park staff or assistance will not be operating, the Interior Department said.\n\nThe mail is still being delivered, Social Security checks are still being processed, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are still running, and veterans\u2019 hospitals are still operating.\n\nMore: The federal government has shut down. What's open, what's closed, what's different.\n\nIt could be short-lived\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has signaled he's open to a proposal to fund the government through Feb. 8, and a key player in the broader negotiations, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he thinks it could work.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said \"there is a path forward.\"\n\n\"We can reach it quickly (Saturday),\" he said. \"The president and the four leaders should immediately sit down and finish this deal so the entire government can get back to work on Monday.\"\n\nMore: Polls suggest Trump and GOP could bear the shutdown blame\n\nIf the shutdown continues\n\nIf an agreement isn't met this weekend, some offices will remain closed, but not as many as the 2013 shutdown, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said.\n\nThe Trump administration's approach, if carried out, would be a reversal from the so-called \"Washington Monument\" strategy that administrations of both parties have used since shutdowns became more common during the Reagan administration. By closing some of the most popular and visible government services, the administration can put pressure on Congress to compromise and inflict less pain on citizens who use government services.\n\nAt least 26 federal agencies updated their shutdown contingency plans Friday in order to make the closures less onerous.\n\nMandatory spending like Social Security and disaster relief will continue, as they have in past shutdowns. Military troops, police and other essential workers would also continue, but their pay could be held up if the shutdown lasts more than a week. Even federal workers told not to report to work would likely be paid eventually \u2014 Congress has historically voted to pay them retroactively.\n\nWhat government officials are saying\n\nCongressional arguments flooded Twitter Saturday. Hashtags such as #TrumpShutdown, #SchumerShutdown and #DemocratShutdown accompanied jabs between parties.\n\nRep. John Delaney of Maryland took a different approach, pledging to donate any congressional pay he receives during the shutdown to a local charity.\n\n\"I don't think it's right for me to get paid while my constituents are being furloughed and important services are being limited,\" Delaney said on Twitter.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown, saying \u201cDemocrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., attacked Democrats for not having a \u201ccompromise\u201d immigration bill on the table.\n\nDemocrats were quick to snap back.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee said the \"great negotiator\" is to blame for the shutdown.\n\n\u201cBefore he took office, @realDonaldTrump was happy to say the president owns the blame for a government shutdown,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. \u201cAs President, he blames Democrats.\u201d\n\nMore: Trump's had some very different views on government shutdowns over the years\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2DvTNaJ", "title": "Government shutdown 2018: What we know now, what happens next", "sourceId": "usa-today", "sourceName": "USA Today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/01/20/what-we-know-government-shutdown/1050666001/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T13:02:31Z"}, {"textData": "Dec. 7, 2005, was a busy day of self-promotion for Donald Trump.

He gave an interview to CNN Headline News in which he talked about his plan to film a subsequent season in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd at Trump Tower in New York, the future president of the United States hosted an event for In Touch, the gossip magazine that this week published a porn star\u2019s claim that the two had sex in July 2006.\n\nAt the event, Trump picked the winner of In Touch\u2019s \u201cWin a Million Dollars Sweepstakes\u201d and presented an oversize check against a backdrop featuring the \u201cApprentice\u201d and In Touch logos.\n\nThe White House has dismissed the alleged encounter between Trump and adult-film actress Stormy Daniels as tabloid trash. But Trump\u2019s denial is complicated by his history of associating with publications such as In Touch and lending credence to their work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018Why didn't the National Enquirer get the Pulitzer Prize for Edwards?\u2019 \u201d Trump said on the campaign trail in 2016. He was referring to the Enquirer\u2019s revelation that John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina and 2008 presidential candidate, had an affair and fathered a child with a campaign aide.\n\nTrump told a crowd in Ohio that the National Enquirer \u201cshould be very respected,\u201d as a way of defending his decision, in an earlier interview, to cite an unsubstantiated article about the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).\n\nThe Enquirer\u2019s top editor during the Edwards investigation, David Perel, was editorial director of In Touch during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe founding editor of In Touch was Richard Spencer (not to be confused with the white nationalist by the same name). Spencer left in 2010 to launch a new magazine called Reality Weekly at the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc. The debut issue of Reality Weekly featured a guest column written by Trump, according to a news release.\n\nSpencer and American Media also hired Omarosa Manigault, a contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who would later work in Trump\u2019s White House, as Reality Weekly\u2019s West Coast editor.\n\nTrump\u2019s friendship with American Media chief executive David Pecker is well documented. Trump has suggested in tweets that Pecker ought to be in charge of Time magazine. And Pecker admitted to the New Yorker last year that in 2016 he squashed a potentially damaging story about a former Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from Jeffrey Toobin\u2019s report:\n\n\u201cWhen her people contacted me that she had a story on Trump, everybody was contacting her,\u201d [Pecker] said. \u201cAt the same time, she was launching her own beauty-and-fragrance line, and I said that I\u2019d be very interested in having her in one of my magazines, now that she\u2019s so famous.\u201d But Pecker had a condition for hiring her: \u201cOnce she\u2019s part of the company, then on the outside she can\u2019t be bashing Trump and American Media.\u201d I pointed out that bashing Trump was not the same as bashing American Media. \u201cTo me it is,\u201d Pecker replied. \u201cThe guy\u2019s a personal friend of mine.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported shortly before Election Day in 2016 that American Media had paid the former model, Karen McDougal, $150,000.\n\nLast week, the Journal reported that Daniels similarly accepted $130,000 from Trump attorney Michael Cohen to keep quiet during the race. Daniels denied the report. At least four other news outlets pursued reports about a sexual encounter between Trump and Daniels, but the Journal was first to publish.\n\nThe Journal even beat In Touch to print, though In Touch had interviewed Daniels in 2011. The new editorial director of In Touch, James Heidenry, told The Washington Post that he does not know why the magazine sat on the interview for seven years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been here since November,\u201d Heidenry told The Post\u2019s Paul Farhi. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to decisions that were made before then.\u201d\n\nHeidenry came to In Touch from American Media, which has Pecker\u2019s don't-bash-Trump rule.\n\n[A porn star had a racy tale about Trump.

As editor of the New York Post\u2019s Page Six, and later as a columnist for New York Newsday, I needed to fill a lot of space, ideally with juicy stories of the rich and powerful, and Trump more than obliged. I wrote about his real estate deals. I wrote about his wife, his yacht, his parties, his houses. At times, I would let several months go by without a single column mention of The Donald; this doubtless upset him, as he loves Page Six and used to have it brought to him the moment it arrived in his office.\n\nTrump even made a bid for the New York Post in 1988 \u2014 after previously bidding for the New York Daily News in 1982.\n\nIn short, the president loves tabloid gossip, which makes it harder for him to just brush it off now, when he is the subject of it.", "title": "Trump\u2019s love of tabloid gossip complicates his denial of affair allegations with Stormy Daniels", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/20/trumps-love-of-tabloid-gossip-complicates-his-denial-of-affair-allegations-with-stormy-daniels/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T13:00:18Z"}, {"textData": "Pilgrimage here to choose from more than 300 cheeses from Italy and America.

She said that the experience \u201cscarred me for life\u201d but that she had remained silent until now because the issue was a social taboo in Pakistan, \u201cshushed away by victims\u2019 families.\u201d\n\nFashion designer Maheem Khan reported on social media that she had been sexually abused as a child by a Muslim cleric \u201cwho came to teach me the Koran. I froze in fear day after day.\u201d She urged her fellow Pakistanis to \u201ctake a look at ourselves as a society\u201d and parents to \u201clisten to your children, teach them, warn them, talk to them openly about what is appropriate and what isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nZainab\u2019s death set off three days of violent rioting in Kasur, a gritty industrial city near the border with India where residents were already on edge after a spate of similar crimes \u2014 including a video porn ring that reportedly targeted nearly 300 children. Most cases were never solved, and some suspects were freed by the courts. Last week, as anger at authorities boiled over, three protesters were fatally shot.\n\n\n\nPeople walk along a street in Kasur in Pakistan's Punjab province. (Arif Ali/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nRights activists said they fear that the furor will die down and little will change, though, largely because of the entrenched political interests, clan loyalties, legal limits and cultural taboos that work against justice in such cases. Witnesses often refuse to testify, police are discouraged from investigating, and courts routinely free accused abusers. There is almost no sex education in public schools, and it was not until two years ago that sexual abuse of minors was made a criminal offense.\n\n[Pakistan struggles to combat child rapes]\n\nAlready, in the days since Zainab\u2019s abduction, a similar case has come to light in northwest Pakistan \u2014 this time with an even younger victim, a girl of 4 named Asma. Her body was found in a sugar cane field with signs of strangulation and rape. Her father was away at the time, working as a construction laborer in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe whole society has reacted strongly in Zainab\u2019s case, but only punishment will deter the recurrence of such crimes,\u201d said Manizeh Bano, executive director of Sahil, a nonprofit group that fights child abuse. In the pedophile porn case, rights groups claimed that from 2009 to 2015, as many as 280 children were abducted and forced to participate in videotaped sex acts. There were protests and calls for justice, but an investigative panel found no evidence of abuse and said the accusations stemmed from a land dispute.\n\nPosters of 7-year-old Zainab Amin, whose rape and slaying here shocked the nation, have been posted all over her community. (Pamela Constable/The Washington Post)\n\nBano, whose group found that most cases of child sexual abuse are never reported, said she was encouraged by the surge of about 100 reported cases since Zainab\u2019s abduction. But in Kasur, she said, there are \u201cpowerful circles\u201d protecting the abusers, reportedly including politicians and police. \u201cUnless such circles are broken, it will be difficult to prevent such cases in the future,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Thursday, in a working-class district of Kasur, TV satellite trucks and police vehicles clogged cement alleys leading to the Amins\u2019 modest home across from a textile factory. A makeshift press podium had been set up in a vacant lot, and posters had been put up showing Zainab\u2019s face surrounded by bloody palm prints.\n\nHer father, a soft-spoken school supply custodian named Muhammad Amin Ansari, received a stream of well-wishers in his dimly lit living room. He and his wife were in Saudi Arabia on a Muslim pilgrimage when their daughter vanished, and they had asked an uncle to look after her.\n\n\u201cI was in Mecca praying for my children, and I came back to this,\u201d said Ansari, 50, a slight man with a gray beard. He said that he was frustrated by the lack of police progress in finding Zainab\u2019s killer but that he hoped the tragedy would help prevent similar crimes in the future. \u201cWe need justice for all such cases,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a cramped bedroom down the hall, Ansari\u2019s wife, Nusrat, 42, spoke in a murmur. She described Zainab, the youngest of her four children, as a studious girl who loved to get up early to study the Koran before school. \u201cI want to look in the eyes of the person who did this, so he can see what I suffered during those five days we were all looking for her,\u201d she said.\n\nMuhammad Amin Ansari, right, the father of Zainab Amin, reviews a police map tracing the girl\u2019s last known movements before her brutal death. (Pamela Constable/The Washington Post)\n\nSo far, though, no breakthroughs in the case have been announced, although a special investigative team has been working around the clock. Officials said that DNA samples suggest that at least half of the 11 other girls found raped and killed in the city over the past two years were victims of the same attacker, raising the fearsome specter of a serial predator at large.\n\nAt the local headquarters of the Punjab province police, a map of the city was pinned to the wall, with labels marking Zainab\u2019s house and the garbage dump where her body was found. Zahid Marwat, the newly named police chief, said more than 200 officers from several security agencies were investigating the case, including young women acting as decoys.\n\n\u201cOur job is to arrest the culprit, and we will not rest until he is caught,\u201d Marwat said. He did not comment on police actions before his arrival but said everything possible is now being done to find Zainab\u2019s attacker. \u201cMore children could be in danger. Society is in a panic and people feel very insecure. There is no way we would take this lightly,\u201d he said.\n\nBut community leaders complained that police had failed to take serious action after the girl was reported missing and security camera tapes showed her walking with a man whose face was clearly visible. Volunteers combed the area for five days, finding nothing until the morning of Jan. 9, when her remains were discovered.\n\nOn Thursday, cars periodically pulled up at the garbage dump and visitors got out, staring at the sea of trash for a few moments before turning away. A bony dog sniffed among the new piles of refuse, and backhoes chugged back and forth, methodically crushing and covering up what lay below.\n\n\n\nPakistani investigators examine the site where the Zainab\u2019s body was found.

What's open, what's closed, what's different.\n\nTrump and Republicans said Democrats insisted on authorization of a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program designed to prevent deportation of younger people brought into the country illegally by their parents. Trump set a March 5 deadline for Congress to pass legislation on this issue when he announced in September that he would revoke an Obama-era executive order protecting these immigrants from deportation.\n\n\"Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration,\" Trump said in his series of tweets Saturday. \"Can\u2019t let that happen!\"\n\nIn an earlier tweet, Trump said that \"Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border.\"\n\nDemocrats like Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer, who negotiated directly with Trump on Friday, said Trump has seemed willing to accept a deal, but keeps getting pulled back by White House aides and other Republicans.\n\n\"Negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jello,\" Schumer said Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, the parties engaged in a hashtag battle to describe the standoff as \"the Trump shutdown\" or \"the Schumer shutdown.\"\n\nTrump argued on social media that \"the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60\" to break a filibuster.\n\nCiting upcoming races in November to determine control of Congress, Trump said, \"that is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election!\"\n\nFor those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60.

(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nPeople back home saw glimpses of it years ago, but the truth is Jalen Ramsey began his public transition from humble kid to world-class trash talker by saying nothing at all.\n\nJamie Redmond, at the time an assistant coach at Ramsey\u2019s private, faith-based high school in Nashville, went to San Antonio in 2013 to watch Ramsey play in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. He had come to know a quiet kid who liked to learn, and earlier that season, Redmond\u2019s son asked to meet Ramsey. The player had come over, taken a knee and made eye contact with Cade before connecting with the boy and sharing a long talk with him. Ramsey was Cade\u2019s hero.\n\nLong before he became the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 best defensive back and perhaps their most impactful player overall, he couldn\u2019t have been nicer, more patient, more willing to toss the ball and connect with him.\n\nBut then the All-America game began, introductions made, and when Ramsey\u2019s name was announced he jogged slowly. He played to the cheers. He ran his mouth.\n\n\u201cJust showboating,\u201d Redmond recalled this week. \u201cI\u2019m like, that\u2019s not the Jalen I know.\u201d\n\nIt is, however, the Jalen who this NFL season has introduced himself to the football universe and become one of its rising stars. He is skilled, brash and ambitious. Nothing is beyond his reach \u2014 not a starting job his freshman season at Florida State nor a national championship, becoming a top-five draft pick in 2016 and an all-pro a season later \u2014 and therefore nothing is beyond Jacksonville\u2019s reach.\n\nThe previously hapless Jaguars aren\u2019t just happy to be playing the big, bad New England Patriots in the AFC championship game this weekend; Ramsey \u2014 and therefore his teammates \u2014 believe they have it in them to unseat the NFL\u2019s postseason kings.\n\n\u201cWe going to the Super Bowl,\u201d the 23-year-old cornerback told a group of fans at Jacksonville\u2019s EverBank Field following his team\u2019s defeat of Pittsburgh last weekend. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to win that b\u2014-!\u201d\n\n\n\nRamsey has gotten inside the heads of several standout wide receivers. (Scott Halleran/Getty Images)\n\nA short while later, Ramsey would ask his Twitter followers to excuse his profanity. But he didn\u2019t exactly apologize.\n\n\u201cI say what people \u2014 what the team is thinking but might not want to say,\u201d Ramsey, whose exceptional play has been perhaps overshadowed by his on-field scuffles with some of the league\u2019s best receivers, told Jacksonville reporters on Friday. \u201cWhy not say it?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. Young Jalen was competitive, sure, and when his father brought him to the fire department where he worked, he liked to watch professional wrestling with the firefighters and mimic Ric Flair and the anti-authority superstars from D-Generation X.\n\n\u201cHe liked a lot of the bad guys,\u201d said Lamont Ramsey, the player\u2019s father. \u201cThe guys who put on the show.\u201d\n\nBut most times, at least then, the kid was easygoing and quiet. He won a math bee in middle school and preferred to play tag and shoot Nerf guns with his nephews. When he reached Brentwood Academy in 11th grade, coaches would\u2019ve barely noticed the young man had he not been so talented.\n\nRamsey was so dominant, so ahead of his age group, that the University of Tennessee offered him a scholarship before he played a single down of varsity football. Former high school coaches said the act embarrassed Ramsey, who in those days was worried about showing up his older teammates, and so he just didn\u2019t talk about it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t talk about much, really, and the three former coaches interviewed for this story couldn\u2019t remember anything provocative Ramsey said on sidelines, in locker rooms, after games or in class. One of those coaches, Ralph Potter, followed the aftermath of Ramsey\u2019s run-in with Green, and weeks later he would say that, \u201cno, it does not remind me of the Jalen that I coached.\u201d\n\nCody White, Brentwood Academy\u2019s coach when Ramsey was a senior, thought the same.\n\n\u201cHis persona out in the public is not what most people see,\u201d said White, adding that he cringed when Ramsey vowed that the Jaguars would defeat the Patriots, winners of two of the past three Super Bowls, on Sunday in Foxborough.\n\nThe coaches wondered what turned him. Who or what had taken their thoughtful young student and turned his tongue silver?\n\nA few weeks after Ramsey signed with Florida State, where he\u2019d become the first freshman to start immediately at cornerback since Deion Sanders, he spent his spring break in Tallahassee watching film with his new team.\n\n\u201cA football junkie,\u201d was how Jeremy Pruitt remembered Ramsey. The head coach at the University of Tennessee coached defensive backs at Florida State when Ramsey came to Tallahassee. \u201cHe was a sponge; you couldn\u2019t give him enough information.\u201d\n\nWhich is to suggest he didn\u2019t say much. No promises of a national title or a place on the All-America team, both of which he accomplished in three seasons. But over time, Ramsey grew bolder. He was good, and he knew it, so as he\u2019d point out years later before the AFC championship: \u201cWhy not say it?\u201d\n\nAt ACC media day one year, Ramsey carried a microphone and interviewed \u2014 taunted might be more accurate \u2014 other teams\u2019 players. \u201cHow\u2019s it feel to let us come back on y\u2019all like that?\u201d he asked a Louisville player, before mimicking a Boston College player\u2019s accent, before reminding a Georgia Tech player of Florida State\u2019s victory against the Yellow Jackets in the ACC championship game.\n\nRamsey publicly suggested he could reach the Olympics as a long-jumper, touted himself as the nation\u2019s best corner, slowly became the type of player who program spokesmen worried about when he faced a microphone.\n\n\u201cThe bigger the crowd,\u201d his father said, \u201cthe more he\u2019s into it.\u201d\n\n\n\nRamsey has learned to relish his time at the microphone. (AP Photo/Gary McCullough)\n\nBy the time Ramsey reached Jacksonville in 2016, the transition was complete. He feuded with Baltimore receiver Steve Smith Sr., later calling Smith an \u201cold man\u201d and that he didn\u2019t respect him as a man. Later that season he was ejected for fighting with an Oakland wideout and last spring he called out Houston star receiver DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nThen came the confrontation with Cincinnati\u2019s A.J. Green this season. Lamont Ramsey, watching from the stands in early November as his son burrowed his way into the receiver\u2019s head, loved it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got A.J.,\u201d the elder Ramsey told someone that day when he knew the battle had been won, and a short time later, Ramsey shoved Green and Green put the cornerback in a chokehold before suplexing him to the ground. Ramsey, after all, always did identify with wrestling\u2019s bad guys.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t take it,\u201d Lamont Ramsey said, \u201cthat\u2019s on you.\u201d\n\nThe soft-spoken and quiet kid from Nashville has largely disappeared, and there\u2019s no sign of that person when he has an audience. Ramsey had one Friday, when someone asked him about defending New England\u2019s Rob Gronkowski, the 6-feet-6 tight end.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t played a corner like me before,\u201d Ramsey said, and if his confidence has empowered the Jaguars, it has confused some of the people from back home.\n\nRedmond, the former coach who once knew a different Jalen, heard about Ramsey\u2019s possible matchup against Gronkowski and would chuckle about it. But last week he came home to learn that Cade, the son who met Ramsey years ago and still looked up to him, heard his hero say more prickly words.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win that b\u2014-!\u201d Ramsey had repeated, and Cade, now 11, was surprised and disappointed.\n\nRedmond wondered if Ramsey had gone too far, lost himself in the character he\u2019d created. Regardless, whenever the Jaguars\u2019 season ends and Ramsey returns to Nashville for a glimpse at his old life, Redmond said he hoped to take the young defender to lunch, ask him to tone it down some and wait to see how the young man reacted, as much as anything to see if, for better or worse, there was any of the old Jalen left.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nPatriots list Tom Brady as questionable for Sunday as HandWatch 2018 rolls on\n\nNFL finds Raiders complied with Rooney Rule after investigation\n\nScot McCloughan on Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins: \u2018I don\u2019t see special\u2019\n\nTalking with \u2018Trell\u2019: Fletcher Cox fueled by conversations with his deceased brother", "title": "Once-quiet Jalen Ramsey has become the NFL's trash-talking, game-changing villain", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/01/20/once-quiet-jalen-ramsey-has-become-the-nfls-trash-talking-game-changing-villain/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T12:45:00Z"}, {"textData": "\n\nMaine Gov. Paul LePage (R) has twice asked the Agriculture Department for permission to ban soda and candy from the state's food stamp program. (Robert F. Bukaty/AP)\n\nMomentum is building for new food stamp restrictions that would ban the purchase of candy and soda. This week, however, the Trump administration denied a request from the state of Maine that would have placed such restrictions on its food stamp program.\n\nThe denial, issued Tuesday, is the first sign that Trump\u2019s Department of Agriculture may prove no more receptive to so-called \u201cjunk food bans\u201d than the previous administration. Now, supporters of such bans are trying to parse the meaning of the rejection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Angela Rachidi, a research fellow in poverty studies at the American Enterprise Institute. A more thorough program proposal, she argued, might still get approved.\n\nThis was Maine's second attempt in two years at improving nutrition in the safety net formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\nFirst in November 2015, and again this past February, the state requested permission to ban food stamp recipients from using their benefits for candy or sugar-sweetened beverages. Such foods have no nutritive value, the state argued, and probably contribute to high rates of obesity.\n\n\"The time has come to stand up to Big Sugar,\u201d Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) said during a Thursday radio address, \u201cand ensure our federal dollars are supporting healthy food choices for our neediest people.\"\n\nBut in a letter to Maine\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, USDA refused the request, citing its own concerns, according to the Portland Press Herald. Among them: additional administrative costs for retailers, difficulties deciding on the exclusion of particular foods and the lack of evidence that such restrictions yield \u201cmeaningful health outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn its application to USDA, Maine said it would evaluate the ban\u2019s impact on soda and candy purchases but did not propose any specific monitoring of health effects. It is not clear if USDA rejected the request because of this kind of omission or because the administration more generally opposes junk food bans.\n\n\"When considering waiver requests, USDA focuses on moving people into self-sufficient lives, protecting the integrity of the program, and improving customer service,\" the agency said in a statement. \"We don't want to be in the business of picking winners and losers among food products in the marketplace, or in passing judgment about the relative benefits of individual food products.\"\n\nThis is the first action the Trump administration has taken on SNAP food restrictions, a subject of growing interest to welfare reformers and public health groups. The American Medical Association has endorsed such restrictions, as have the American Heart Association and the American Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nThe bans are seen as a way to improve the nutrition of people on public assistance \u2014 as well as better target $73 billion in public funds. A 2016 report by the Agriculture Department showed that households on SNAP, much like households that are not on the program, spend heavily on snack foods, desserts and sodas.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely inconsistent with the goals of the program,\u201d said Rachidi, who helped draft a now-rejected ban on sugar-sweetened beverage for the food-stamp program in New York. \u201cSoda has no nutritional value. No one can argue that it does.\u201d\n\nBut many economists and anti-hunger activists disagree with the junk food ban approach \u2014 as do grocery stores and other retailers, who have described the new regulations as an \u201cadministrative nightmare.\u201d They have faulted such proposals for imposing a burden on businesses, who would have to update their point-of-sale systems to accommodate the new rules, as well as for stigmatizing low-income shoppers.\n\nThe biggest problem, said Diane Schanzenbach, the director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, is that no state has yet proposed a junk food ban that could be successfully implemented or evaluated after the fact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard, even to just define soda \u2014 or, God forbid, junk food,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do you draw that line? And how do you come up with a rigorous test to gauge effectiveness?\u201d\n\nMaine, at least, is not prepared to give up on those questions. In an email, Julie Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for LePage, said the state planned to \"revise and resubmit,\" for the third time, its USDA waiver request.\n\nIt probably won't be alone, either. In addition to Maine, New York, Illinois and Minnesota have requested approval to ban junk food or soda from SNAP.\n\nAll were rejected, but experts expect more states will make these requests in the future. The power to restrict the foods bought with benefits has long been a demand of the Secretaries\u2019 Innovation Group, an organization representing welfare directors from states with Republican leadership.\n\nIn that regard, Rachidi said, the government tangle over food bans has only just begun.

He threatened to sue author Michael Wolff, whom he called \u201ca total loser.\u201d He called a former staffer \u201cSloppy,\u201d one U.S. senator \u201cSneaky\u201d and another \u201cDicky.\u201d He said his \u201ctwo greatest assets\u201d were \u201cmental stability and being, like, really smart.\u201d\n\nHe began the new year by announcing \u201cTHE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR,\u201d which he postponed, and then \u201cThe Fake News Awards,\u201d which were just a GOP fundraising gimmick, and by expressing his desire to open up libel laws. I began the new year by expressing gratitude that Trump had not tweeted pictures of his penis yet. Two days later, Trump bragged about his \u201cNuclear Button\u201d and how \u201cmuch bigger & more powerful\u201d it was than Kim Jong Un\u2019s.

Hours earlier, I tweeted: \u201cThere\u2019s a greater chance that Trump knows the lyrics to \u2018I\u2019m Too Sexy\u2019 than to the national anthem.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m no prophet, just an observer of the obvious. What\u2019s obvious is that Trump is the opposite of what he says he is: a very unstable stupid person.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers last week, he called Haiti, El Salvador and African countries \u201cshithole countries.\u201d To rebut accusations of racism, he told reporters that he\u2019s \u201cthe least racist person you have ever interviewed.\u201d Now he\u2019s denying an affair with a porn star rather than, as one might expect, bragging about how awesome it was.\n\nTrump is so ridiculous that it\u2019s hard to keep track of how awful he is. Fortunately, some people are trying. Amy Siskind publishes a weekly list of Trump\u2019s misdeeds, while The Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler and Toronto Star\u2019s Daniel Dale keep tabs on his falsehoods.

If you endeavor to do the same, you will be quickly overwhelmed by the enormity of the task.\n\nA year into Trump\u2019s presidency, we know what we knew when he announced his candidacy in 2015. The only difference now is that we have more proof.\n\n\u201cTrump is a joke, but people like jokes, even sick and repetitive ones,\u201d I wrote in July 2015. \u201cWith Trump, people know what they are getting: unremitting buffoonery.\u201d\n\nOur tolerance for his buffoonery is also unremitting. My scorn for Trump has grown stale and ineffectual. I know I\u2019m not persuading anyone, but he doesn\u2019t give me much choice. What is one to do? Act like he\u2019s normal?

(Bastien Inzaurralde,Jordan Frasier/The Washington Post)\n\nCongressional leaders in both parties refused to budge publicly from their political corners Saturday on the first day of the government shutdown, avoiding direct negotiations and bitterly blaming each other for the impasse in speeches. President Trump joined the fray with a series of charged tweets.\n\nBut private glimmers of a breakthrough were evident by late Saturday, as moderate Democrats and Republicans began to rally behind a new short-term funding proposal to reopen the government through early February.\n\nThat plan could include funding for storm-ravaged states, reauthorization of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2014 and an implicit agreement to hold votes at some point in the coming weeks on a bipartisan immigration deal, according to senators involved in the discussions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed on the Senate floor late Saturday to take up a new spending plan by Monday morning, or sooner, that would keep government open through Feb. 8 but would not contain a solution for \u201cdreamers,\u201d undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children.\n\n\u201cHe wants to keep the government shut down until we finish a negotiation on the subject of illegal immigration,\u201d McConnell said of his Democratic counterpart, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). McConnell repeated himself: \u201cShutting down government over illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nThe moderate senators, meanwhile, are trying to reach a deal on immigration in hopes that, should a three-week spending accord be approved, McConnell would allow it to come up for a vote alongside a longer-term spending plan.\n\nDemocrats, however, remained intensely opposed to McConnell\u2019s approach, unsure he would agree and frustrated by Republicans\u2019 refusal to meet their demands on immigration while the government is closed. At issue for Democrats is the fate of thousands of young immigrants eligible for protection from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Trump canceled the program in September, and it is set to expire in March. Lawmakers are scrambling to enact a legislative solution.\n\nDemocrats also questioned the ability of the negotiating group to reach an agreement that can pass the Senate and House and also earn Trump\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cThe conversation that needs to take place is the conversation at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where the president of the United States brings in the four leaders from Congress,\u201d said Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.). \u201cWe can come up with the best compromise in the world. The key is how to get it through the House and the way to do that is for the president to provide the air cover that he has not so far provided.\u201d\n\nLawmakers in both chambers were scheduled to return to work Sunday afternoon.\n\nMcConnell and Schumer did little in public Saturday besides trade insults in brief speeches on the Senate floor or on television.\n\n\u201cDo you know what number CR this is? This has been going on for six months,\u201d Schumer told CNN, using the legislative term for a short-term spending deal, a continuing resolution. \u201cThis is the fourth time. They can\u2019t get it done and they just use these CRs.\u201d\n\nFunding for government lapsed early Saturday morning, as a short term spending bill stalled in the Senate. Lawmakers have been busy pointing fingers at who's to blame for the impasse. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nMcConnell hunkered down in his office and played phone tag most of the day with Trump, updating him on where things stood and projecting an air of confidence that he was in a strong position, according to GOP senators.\n\nThere were no substantive talks between Schumer and McConnell. The real effort at bridging the divide was that bipartisan collection of roughly 20 senators from the less ideological wings of their respective caucuses. That group met and was trying to advance a deal that would open the government for three more weeks and set up a series of votes on competing immigration proposals. Still, several Senate Republicans said that McConnell was in no mood to give Schumer any assurances to open up the government.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) are leading the moderate group, with Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), both of whom have worked closely with Schumer on immigration issues in the past, serving as go-betweens for the two parties. The duo shuttled back and forth between Schumer\u2019s and McConnell\u2019s offices on the second floor of the Capitol trying to forge a political peace, but they left for dinner shortly after 6 p.m. with no solid agreement with either leader.\n\nIt is unclear whether there is enough bipartisan support for the immigration proposal being floated by the moderates \u2014 or for one that Senate conservatives are also drafting. And the possibility of no resolution to the immigration standoff before the DACA deadline remained.\n\nSo far, Trump, McConnell and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have refused to consider Democrats\u2019 demands until there is a bipartisan agreement to reopen the federal government.\n\n\u201cSenate Democrats shut down this government, and now Senate Democrats need to open this government back up,\u201d Ryan said in a midday speech.\n\nTrump, who spent the day at the White House, weighed in on Twitter: \u201cDemocrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!\u201d\n\n[House Republicans are unusually united that the shutdown is Democrats\u2019 fault]\n\nIn a bid to move past the political squabbling, the moderate senators met for a second day in Collins\u2019s office. She led a similar bipartisan group in working to resolve the last shutdown in 2013.\n\nModerates are \u201ctrying to find a pathway forward,\u201d Manchin said.\n\n[Everything you need to know about the shutdown]\n\nDemocratic leaders made their case for blaming Republicans for the shutdown. As thousands of women gathered along the Mall in Washington to protest Trump\u2019s first year in office, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stood at the Capitol and pointed to a poster depicting a Trump tweet from last May calling for a \u201cgood shutdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy anniversary, Mr. President,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cYour wish came true. You wanted the shutdown? The shutdown is all yours.\u201d\n\nTrump, who marked the first anniversary of his inauguration on Saturday, canceled plans to visit his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., for a weekend of celebrations. His scheduled trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this coming week was also up in the air, according to an aide.\n\nAt the White House, a phone line for comments directed callers to voice mail with a message slamming Democrats. \u201cUnfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are holding government funding, including funding for our troops and other national security priorities, hostage to an unrelated immigration debate. Due to this obstruction, the government is shut down,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice said on the message.\n\n[The strong case that Trump is a big reason the government is shut down]\n\nThe White House said it supports the plan for funding through Feb. 8, eliminating a potentially significant hurdle to its enactment. Yet the simmering tensions between the Trump administration and Schumer, who said Saturday that negotiating with the president was like negotiating with \u201cJell-O,\u201d underscored the delicacy of the moment.\n\nSchumer and Trump had met privately on Friday afternoon, giving some lawmakers optimism that their deliberations would advance a deal to avoid a shutdown.\n\nSchumer left the meeting buoyed, telling others that Trump seemed willing to strike a deal on a days-long funding extension in exchange for concessions such as border wall funding. But by midnight, he complained to his members that Trump had suddenly reneged on the possibility.\n\nThe White House told a different story. Briefing reporters at the White House on Saturday, budget director Mick Mulvaney disputed Schumer\u2019s claim that he offered Trump his desired border wall funding during their meeting.\n\n\u201cMr. Schumer has to up his game and be more honest with the president of the United States if we are going to be seeing progress,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nSchumer spokesman Matt House fired back on Twitter that Mulvaney, who was not present for the meeting, was \u201cnot telling the truth\u201d about what happened.\n\n[Shutdown dynamics highlight the state of politics on Trump\u2019s anniversary]\n\nDemocrats pushed for a shutdown to spite Trump for his accomplishments, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short argued to reporters.\n\n\u201cTheir reaction is, \u2018Because we can\u2019t beat them, what we\u2019re going to do is shut down the government,\u2019 \u201d he said in a news briefing Saturday.\n\nThere was scattered and acrimonious activity on the House and Senate floors.\n\nMcConnell sought to bring up the four-week spending bill that failed Friday night; Democrats blocked the attempt. Democrats asked to vote on a bill guaranteeing federal workers their back pay for the period of the shutdown; McConnell objected, saying they deserve a full funding bill.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee who objected to McConnell\u2019s attempt to revive the short-term bill, questioned McConnell\u2019s embrace of the GOP proposal to extend funding of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2014 and highlighted the discord that defined the day.\n\n\u201cHe sounded like Marian Wright Edelman last night, the founder of the Children\u2019s\u2019 Defense Fund, with his newfound interest in the children\u2019s health plan,\u201d Wyden said in an interview. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m listening to Ted Kennedy talk about health. . . . I\u2019ve never heard of this being a priority [for Republicans].\u201d\n\nIn the House, lawmakers prepared for a possible deal by debating a special rule allowing them to consider any bill that passes the Senate on the same day. The debate devolved into a shouting match over displaying disparaging photos of other members \u2014 such as Schumer \u2014 on the floor.\n\n[Huddled masses?

(Amazon.com image)\n\nSometimes what\u2019s not in a book stands out more than what is.\n\nIn 2015, comedian Aziz Ansari published a book with sociologist Eric Klinenberg about the realities and frustrations of dating. I read and wrote about \u201cModern Romance\u201d when it came out; and I read it again this week, after the website Babe.net published an account of a first date that an anonymous woman dubbed \u201cGrace\u201d had with Ansari last year.\n\nIf you\u2019ve somehow avoided the onslaught of coverage this week, here\u2019s the gist: According to Grace\u2019s telling, she let Ansari know, verbally and non-verbally, that she was uncomfortable with how quickly things were getting physical, and by the end of the night felt she had been \u201ctaken advantage of by Aziz.\u201d Ansari, 35, responded to Grace\u2019s account, saying that to him the night \u201cby all indications was completely consensual.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason Ansari\u2019s night with Grace has been such a big news story is because Ansari isn\u2019t just a comedian who happens to talk about dating and relationships in his stand-up and his Netflix series \u201cMaster of None\u201d \u2014 he also fashions himself a dating guru. So presumably he\u2019s thought about what makes a hookup good for everyone involved.\n\nFor \u201cModern Romance,\u201d Ansari and Klinenberg convened focus groups with hundreds singles in the United States and abroad. The book isn\u2019t so much a dating advice book as it is a distillation of why online dating can be so difficult and confusing \u2014 and how and why dating and courtship have changed so much, so quickly.\n\n\u201cOur search for the right person \u2014 and even our idea of what \u2018the right person\u2019 actually means \u2014 has changed radically in a very, very short amount of time,\u201d they write.\n\nAnd another thing that\u2019s changed in a very, very short amount of time: In 2015, two men could write a book about dating that barely mentions sex \u2014 and doesn\u2019t mention consent \u2014 and that absence wouldn\u2019t seem notable. A mere few years ago, men weren\u2019t expected to draw attention to harassment, rape, coercion or sex that\u2019s not assault but not quite consensual, either. It wouldn\u2019t have been off-limits, but for decades women have been the ones writing about sex, power, rape culture and consent and the ones pushing for change. In today\u2019s climate, more readers \u2014 male and female \u2014 might expect a book about dating to address consent.\n\nSo if consent is absent from the book, what is there? The book is mostly about the increased popularity of online dating and the frustrations that stem from it. From 2005 to 2012, for example, a third of couples who got married in the United States met through an online dating site. The authors look at how the Internet has expanded singles\u2019 options and made it harder to pick just one. \u201cModern Romance\u201d speaks well to the difficulty of asking someone out over text message; of how hard and important it is to come up with interesting rather than boring dates; the pain of breaking up over text; the prevalence of sexting and infidelity; the pain of ghosting; and more.\n\nThe authors note that women deal with nonsense from men, but they\u2019re mostly talking about men being bad at texting or overly sexual in their messages; they don\u2019t say much about men\u2019s in-person interactions. \u201cOne firm takeaway from all our interviews with women is that most dudes out there are straight-up bozos,\u201d the authors write, with Ansari adding: \u201cI\u2019ve spent hours talking with women and seeing the kind of \u2018first texts\u2019 they get from guys, and trust me, it\u2019s infuriating. These were attractive, amazing women and they all deserved better.\u201d\n\nAnsari does mention casual sex, but mostly in the context of how it helped him grow as a person. (He was in a long-term relationship when he wrote the book.) \u201cSay what you will about casual sex and the substance and quality of that experience, but the encounters I had in my own periods of singledom helped me grow as a person and brought me to a place to be ready to have a serious relationship,\u201d Ansari writes. \u201cIt also made me realize the true value of that sort of connection and better understand the advantages and disadvantages of a serious relationship. Dating has its downsides, but it can be a lot of fun. Even when it isn\u2019t, when you\u2019re meeting other people there are always experiences that you remember and learn from.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who will push a woman to be physical when she\u2019s uncomfortable, but of course, Ansari on the page is not a carbon copy of Ansari in person. In the book, he doesn\u2019t go into the nitty-gritty of how those hookups went down \u2014 had he written about \u201cthe claw,\u201d a move Grace describes in excruciating detail, for sure there would have been women readers recoiling. Now he\u2019s got a new experience to learn from and hopefully will come up with some new ways to make out.\n\nMost of the discussion about sex in this book is about sex that happens overseas, specifically in Tokyo (which is experiencing a decline in sexual interest) and in Buenos Aires (which the authors describe as having a \u201cromantically aggressive culture\u201d). In Tokyo, according to Ansari and Klinenberg, women often complain about the \u201cherbivore man,\u201d which isn\u2019t a note about his diet; the word describes Japanese men who are shy, passive, so afraid of rejection that they show no interest in sex and romantic relationships.\n\n\u201cSurveys suggest that about 60 percent of male singles in their 20s and 30s identify themselves as herbivores,\u201d the authors note, linking the phenomenon to the decline of the Japanese economy. \u201cWith career jobs now gone, it\u2019s not only harder for men to meet a partner, but also harder for them to support her financially,\u201d they write. \u201cSo it makes sense that insecurity might leave men scared of rejection.\u201d\n\nOf course there are also \u201comnivorous\u201d men who pursue booty calls, the book notes. But the herbivore man sounds similar to what some Americans fear: That the #MeToo movement will make men too scared to have sex at all.\n\nThe opposite is the Argentine man who\u2019s so sexually aggressive he won\u2019t take no for an answer, the authors posit. One focus group includes a 28-year-old man who\u2019s an expat from New York but mirrors the attitude of Argentine men, saying, \u201cHere, if [women] say no, they\u2019re interested.\u201d The women the authors interviewed said that \u201cbeing the object of unsolicited male attention was a daily occurrence, and many men were reluctant to take no for an answer.\u201d\n\nThis kind of behavior sneaks into the stereotype of the typical American man, too \u2014 it\u2019s the kind of thing the #MeToo movement is trying to draw attention to and correct. Of course it\u2019s possible for men to be neither of these extremes and instead be respectful and desirous simultaneously. Ansari can still be a voice in the conversation about how to do that, especially after his own experience that has dozens of question marks hovering above it.\n\nRead more:\n\nAziz Ansari fashions himself a dating guru.

As few as 60 remain in the wild, according to a paper published last week in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases describing the find.\n\nAnd the find is surprising. The disease, called canine distemper virus (CDV), infects many animals besides dogs, but it is rarely found in cats. Research published in 2001 in the journal Clinical and Vaccine Immunology suggests that when cats do catch CDV, it\u2019s usually because they\u2019ve been in close contact with dogs.\n\n[ Facts about leopards ]\n\nThe approximately 2-year-old wild female was spotted on May 8, 2015, close to a road running through Russia\u2019s Land of the Leopard National Park, according to the paper.\n\n\u201cOn initial approach, the leopard showed a lack of fear toward people and vehicles and an indifference to its surroundings,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nA team of conservationists gave the 61-pound big cat drugs to immobilize it, then hauled it back to a care facility.

As the creature\u2019s condition deteriorated, caregivers made the decision to euthanize the cat.\n\nThat the leopard had CDV is a big deal, the researchers wrote, because the more a species\u2019 population dwindles, the more susceptible it is to shocks from disease outbreaks. CDV spreads more easily among social cats such as lions when big-cat outbreaks do occur, but the new paper suggests that it\u2019s still a significant threat to the more solitary Amur leopard.\n\n\u2014 Live Science\n\nRead More\n\nThis Instagram account is putting the spotlight on animal extinction\n\nRare amur leopard photos\n\n10 facts for cat lovers\n\n[]", "title": "Virus terrible for dogs shows up in critically endangered leopard - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/virus-terrible-for-dogs-shows-up-in-critically-endangered-leopard/2018/01/19/3e02a452-fc65-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T12:04:21Z"}, {"textData": "LAUSANNE, Switzerland \u2014 IOC says Korean teams will march together at Pyeongchang Olympics opening ceremony; 22 North Korean athletes to compete.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAt year\u2019s end, President Trump repeatedly boasted of his \u201clegislative approvals,\u201d claiming to have broken \u201ca record long held\u201d by Harry Truman: \u201cAnd we beat him on legislative approvals, for which I get no credit.\u201d That might have been because just 97 laws were enacted in 2017. All recent presidents, in their first year of office, signed more bills into law than did Trump, with George H.W. Bush at 240; Bill Clinton, 210; George W. Bush, 108; Barack Obama, 125.\n\nAs for Truman? The 80th Congress, which Truman would excoriate as \u201cdo nothing,\u201d passed 395 bills into law in 1947 alone.\n\nPicking up the executive powers where Obama left off\n\nObviously raw numbers matter less than substantive significance. The new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 though not \u201cthe biggest tax cut, the biggest reform of all time\u201d \u2014 is clearly consequential. But on the whole, the major policy changes Trump achieved in his first year came mostly from the use of administrative power, not via Congress.\n\nIs that unusual? Under the circumstances, perhaps.\n\nBefore becoming president, Trump had railed against using executive orders as substitutes for lawmaking, arguing Obama did so \u201cbecause he couldn\u2019t get anybody to agree with him.\u201d But Obama turned to his \u201cpen and phone\u201d after Democrats lost their legislative majorities, while Trump\u2019s Republican \u201canybodies\u201d preside over unified party control of government. Perhaps it is odd, too, for a presidency pledging the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d to embrace what Elena Kagan once termed \u201cpresidential administration.\u201d\n\nBut in terms of presidential history, Trump\u2019s use of the executive toolbox is very much consonant with past practice. And it has achieved quite a bit.\n\nThis is not because of Trump\u2019s use of executive orders, though he did issue 55 of them in 2017, the highest figure by a single president in a single year since Bill Clinton\u2019s 57 in 1993. (Clinton and Bush combined for 63 in 2001.) Here too, though, we must look past the numbers to the substance, which varied widely. Consider Executive Order 13186, issued Dec. 8, which approved a new seal for the National Credit Union Administration. Some seem to have been issued as executive orders rather than memos or news releases simply to boost the total count. Others were quite important: for instance, those dealing with regulatory matters. Trump used one early executive order to require that two regulations be rescinded for every new one issued and to impose a regulatory budget on the government aiming at zero net costs.\n\nBut executive orders are just one tool in the president\u2019s box. According to my update of figures provided by USA Today\u2019s Gregory Korte, Trump also signed 59 presidential memorandums and issued more than 100 proclamations. Again, these vary in their importance; some are purely symbolic (though I hope you vigorously celebrated \u201cWright Brothers Day\u201d back on Dec. 17.) Some simply extend deadlines. But others put bureaucratic wheels in progress, especially in prompting \u2014 you\u2019ll see a theme here \u2014 the reconsideration of regulation. The third version of the \u201ctravel ban\u201d was enacted by proclamation. So were Trump\u2019s controversial decisions to relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and to scale back the size of two national monuments in Utah.\n\nA statute says whatever the president says it says, right?\n\nThat last action highlights another frequent use of executive authority: reading new meaning into old laws, or statutory interpretation. The text of the 1906 Antiquities Act does not specifically include the power to shrink national monuments once they are created. The Trump administration argues that this is inherent in the power to create such designations. Maybe so; like many such claims before it, this will wind up in court. The Obama Justice Department said immigration statutes allowed the president to create the Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; the Trump Justice Department says they do not. And herein lies an odd result in relying on executive authority to steer government: It can lead to head-swivelling reversals, as we\u2019ve seen in everything from the rights of transgender students to, most recently, the religious rights of health-care providers.\n\nThat\u2019s true not just in regulation, but in courtrooms. Trump lawyers backed away from a number of suits concerning voting rights that the Obama administration had enthusiastically pursued, and they told an appeals panel that the administration would withdraw and replace the pending Clean Power Plan drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama. But there are also important continuities in the legal claims presidents make: Somehow ignoring my own highly persuasive writing about this subject, both administrations concluded, for example, that the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force extends well beyond its textual reference to those who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nIn courts \u2014 and before ever getting to court \u2014 presidents often assert prosecutorial discretion, making choices about how to use limited resources to execute the laws. The Obama administration chose to avoid bringing charges that would set off mandatory minimum sentencing laws, for example, and chose to de-emphasize federal laws banning the use of marijuana in states that had legalized its recreational use. The Trump administration has reversed both decisions. Often such shifts are made by agencies in relatively low-salience ways, as with the Interior Department\u2019s new encouragement of oil exploration and fracking on public lands.\n\nGoodbye to all that regulation\n\nAs all this suggests, a consistent theme in an administration not know for consistency has been its dedicated use of the administrative machinery to roll back regulation. Numerous pending agency rules were frozen in January and seem unlikely to be thawed, while Susan Dudley notes that the pace of new regulation has slowed dramatically too. Canceling existing regulations takes much longer, generally \u2014 it requires the same level of justification as it took to promulgate the rule in the first place \u2014 but the process was jump-started when Congress used the 1996 Congressional Review Act to overturn 15 Obama-era rules.\n\nWill these changes stick? As Adam White recently noted, \u201cIf \u2026 the Trump administration has declared \u2018war\u2019 on the regulatory state, then year two will be the time for the administration to show that it planned not just for the invasion but also for the long-term occupation.\u201d Some of these shifts will be overturned in court. Others will be hampered by the unprecedented plethora of vacancies in the executive agencies \u2014 sub-cabinet appointees are among presidents\u2019 chief means of influencing bureaucratic behavior. Others can be revoked at the ballot box: As Trump himself has demonstrated, what one administration puts in place, another may tear asunder.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth remembering that the midterm ballot might be just as important. Congress has the power to constrain how various administrations execute the law \u2014 by writing clear law. As John Kelly said when he was homeland security secretary, before moving to the White House, \u201cif lawmakers do not like the laws they\u2019ve passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should have the courage and skill to change the laws.\u201d He had a point.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\n[Experts gave Trump an \u2018F\u2019 on his first year as president.]\n\n[Trump makes fewer public trips than recent presidents.

Boone is the personification of that,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cHe bets big. He has big ideas. And he puts big numbers behind it.\u201d\n\nWith an outsize personality and aggressive business tactics that landed him on the cover of Time magazine, Mr. Pickens became one of the few businessmen in the 1980s recognizable to wide segments of America. His influence is still widely felt. Mr. Pickens was an early advocate for shareholder rights and insisting that executives be compensated with stock. That line of thinking informed a new generation of shareholder activists, and remains gospel on Wall Street.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI hope people think of me as a visionary who recognized it was important to show a new look periodically,\u201d Mr. Pickens said in an email, via an assistant. \u201cPredictability leads to failure.\u201d\n\nMr. Pickens experienced both wild success and crushing failure during his career. He made a fortune hunting for oil in unproven terrain in the 1950s and \u201960s, then reinvented himself as a corporate raider in the 1970s and \u201980s. He incorrectly predicted \u201cPeak Oil\u201d \u2014 the idea that the maximum rate of extraction had been achieved \u2014 and lost millions with an early bet on wind energy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA major Republican donor, Mr. Pickens supported Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which leveled false allegations against John Kerry during the 2004 presidential campaign. Along the way, he had five wives, became a major philanthropist and saw the football stadium at Oklahoma State University, his alma mater, named for him after a donation of hundreds of millions of dollars to the school.\n\nEven in his later years, he never stopped looking for another big score. He bought nearly 400,000 acres of water rights in the Texas Panhandle, hoping to sell that water to Dallas and Fort Worth. And last year he began drilling on his own ranch.\n\nYet Mr. Pickens\u2019s most lasting impact on business has nothing to do with oil. As a corporate raider in the 1980s, Mr. Pickens \u2014 along with men like Carl C. Icahn and Michael Milken \u2014 helped develop a shrewd new playbook for making money. He would take a small stake in a public company, call on it to slash expenses and return money to investors, and often pressure the company to sell itself. He was Gordon Gekko before \u201cWall Street,\u201d and his influence was profound.\n\nThat philosophy now shapes the investment decisions of big institutional investors and shareholder activists alike. Depending on whom you ask, it is responsible for the creation of a huge amount of wealth for a great many people, or for a reckless short-term perspective that is widening income inequality and destroying jobs. In either case, it happened, at least in part, because of T. Boone Pickens.\n\n\u201cToday you\u2019re seeing in corporate America a lot of the things that he espoused 30 years ago,\u201d said David Bradshaw, an investment banker at Moelis and Company who is close to Mr. Pickens. \u201cHe was ahead of his time.\u201d\n\nSmart and Shrewd\n\nMr. Pickens was born in Oklahoma\u2019s oil patch in 1928. His father was a landman, buying leases from farmers and selling them to oil companies, and his mother oversaw gasoline rationing for several counties during World War II.\n\nWhen Mr. Pickens was a teenager, the family moved to Amarillo, where his father began working for Phillips Petroleum. In 1951, Mr. Pickens earned a degree in geology from what is now Oklahoma State University, and went to work for Phillips.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter just three years, he struck out on his own as an oilman, traveling the state by car, shaving in gas station restrooms, raising money from investors, buying up patches of land and drilling in the oil-rich Permian Basin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPickens got farther than most,\u201d Daniel Yergin wrote in \u201cThe Prize,\u201d his authoritative history of the oil business. \u201cHe was smart and shrewd, with an ability to analyze and think through a problem, step by step.\u201d\n\nA decade on, he had raised money from New York investors and consolidated his various holdings into Mesa Petroleum, which he took public in 1964.\n\nAs the chief executive of a publicly traded corporation, he came to understand that the markets didn\u2019t always do a good job of determining the true value of a company. Oftentimes, the oil and gas in the ground were worth substantially more than what was reflected in the share price.\n\nWith this insight, Mr. Pickens attempted to take over Hugoton Production, a larger competitor that he believed was undervalued. In 1969, his hostile takeover succeeded, and he merged Hugoton into Mesa.\n\nSome years later, he acquired a stake in another company, Cities Service, and then tried to acquire the company. In doing so, he kicked off a bidding war, which he ultimately lost when Cities Service was acquired by Occidental. Nonetheless, he made $30 million in profit on his shares.\n\nAt the time, mergers were reshaping the oil and gas industry, and Mr. Pickens reinvented himself as a full-blown corporate raider. In 1983, Mesa began to buy Gulf Oil stock. Mr. Pickens then pressured Gulf to restructure itself in a way that would lower taxes and give shareholders higher dividends, raising the share price.\n\n\u201cBack then, corporate managers thought they owned the companies they ran,\u201d Mr. Pickens said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t, and often had little ownership in those companies. Arguing that shareholders were the owners and management just employees was a novel concept.\u201d\n\nAs a result of Mr. Pickens\u2019s agitating, Gulf Oil was sold to Chevron for $13.2 billion. Mesa made $500 million. Mr. Pickens hadn\u2019t taken over Gulf Oil. But simply by showing up and stirring things up, he made shareholders, including himself, a great deal of money.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the years to come, Mr. Pickens followed a similar playbook with many companies, including Unocal, Phillips, Newmont Mining and Diamond Shamrock. Again and again, he would take a stake, cause some trouble and make substantial profits for himself and others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t afraid to stand up to some of these guys in the oil patch,\u201d Mr. Icahn said in an interview. \u201cBack in the \u201980s, that went a long way to letting them know that shareholders have certain rights.\u201d\n\nBut as the boomtown mentality of the 1980s receded, Mr. Pickens would not always keep up with the times.\n\n\u201cIn oil, you can make a lot of money and lose a lot of money,\u201d Ms. Jaffe said. \u201cAnd it can happen very quickly.\u201d\n\nNot Wrong, Just Early\n\nBy 1996, Mr. Pickens had receded from the spotlight, and his fortune was dwindling. Mesa was sputtering, and when new management came in, Mr. Pickens left the company he had built from the dusty ground up.\n\nSo he started a hedge fund.\n\nIt was the \u201990s after all, and Mr. Pickens raised some $30 million from friends, chipped in about $10 million of his own and called it BP Capital. The losses came swiftly, and within three years, he had squandered almost all of the money.\n\nThen in 2000, he bet heavily on natural gas, believing that the price would soon rise. He was right, and again made a mint. Mr. Pickens proceeded to go on a hot streak, correctly betting on price fluctuations in oil and gas for years and becoming a billionaire.\n\nHe began giving away money as fast as he made it. He donated $50 million to University of Texas institutions in Houston and Dallas. He has given some $500 million to Oklahoma State, where the football team now plays in Boone Pickens Stadium. And he developed Mesa Vista Ranch, acquiring adjacent properties, installing man-made lakes and erecting palatial estates.\n\n\u201cI truly believe I was put on this Earth to make money, but also to be generous with it,\u201d Mr. Pickens, whose current worth is estimated at $500 million, said in his email.\n\nPhoto\n\nFamously cantankerous, Mr. Pickens made his share of enemies. He was accused of being a \u201cgreenmailer\u201d \u2014 taking a stake in a company and then making himself so annoying that management would pay him to go away \u2014 though that\u2019s not precisely what he did.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd his views on immigration have often been extreme. Mr. Pickens, who hosted a fund-raising meeting for President Trump at Mesa Vista, echoed the president\u2019s calls for a curb on immigration from Middle Eastern countries. \u201cI\u2019d cut off the Muslims from coming into the United States until we can vet these people,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pickens was still restless in his early 80s. In 2008, convinced that the United States\u2019 reliance on oil imported from the Middle East posed a major economic and national security threat, he pushed what he called the Pickens Plan. It was an effort to convince Americans that it was time to abandon Middle Eastern oil, embrace natural gas and make a transition to renewable power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re infidels with most of these people, and they have no use for us,\u201d he said in 2010. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more and more dependent on the wrong people.\u201d\n\nMr. Pickens spent upward of $100 million promoting his ideas. Around the same time, he announced plans to build the world\u2019s largest wind farm in the Texas Panhandle.\n\nThey were bold bets, but they were misguided. Within years, the cost of both oil and gas had fallen. The wind farm was never built.\n\nAccepting Mortality\n\nAs Mr. Pickens withdraws from the public stage, his influence is still widely felt. When activist investors like Nelson Peltz and Bill Ackman take on big-name companies like Procter & Gamble and Chipotle, they are, wittingly or not, following in his footsteps.\n\n\u201cThis way of thinking about value and the shareholder was revolutionary at the time,\u201d Ms. Jaffe said. \u201cHe set a course that others imitate today.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver the past year, Mr. Pickens suffered a series of strokes, and took what he described as a \u201cTexas-sized fall.\u201d His failing health prompted a bout of self-reflection.\n\n\u201cJust a year ago I felt immortal, wearing my age with pride, even joking about it,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cBut things have changed for me since the strokes. I clearly am in the fourth quarter, and the clock is ticking and my health is in decline, much as it is with others in my stage of life.\u201d\n\nIt was a remarkable admission from a wildcatter who, even at 89 years old, was still drilling. Mr. Pickens, who shook up the oil business, who shaped a generation of shareholder activists, who supported dubious propaganda aimed at a presidential candidate and who was ahead of his time in evangelizing for renewable energy, was finally calling it quits.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t for a minute think I\u2019m being morbid,\u201d Mr. Pickens wrote. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the oil business like I\u2019ve been all my life, you drill your fair share of dry holes, but you never lose your optimism.\u201d", "title": "T.

She and her husband, Don McGuire, 73, left Philadelphia in August to move into the Aria Cohousing Community, a former convent close to parks and Regis University. The convent\u2019s dwindling community of seven nuns vacated the building when they could no longer maintain it, said Aria\u2019s developer, Susan Powers of Urban Ventures LLC in Denver. The initial group of residents, who in 2013 expressed interest in transforming the building into a cohousing community, had a bit in common with the previous tenants.\n\n\u201cThey were a group of single women, empty-nesters, who each lived in a single-family home and didn\u2019t want to live alone anymore,\u201d Ms. Powers said. Aria, which opened in August, now includes men and residents of every age.\n\nThe self-determination of Aria\u2019s founding residents is a hallmark of cohousing, along with clusters of houses or living spaces gathered around shared public areas. The heart of each community is the common house, or a space, where group meals are offered once or twice a week, together with activities and events. Houses are connected by pathways. Instead of a lawn mower in every garage, there often are no attached garages. Cars are exiled to peripheral parking areas, while a single, shared lawn mower suits the needs of everyone.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe common house is also where residents gather to make decisions about governance. Cohousing communities are most commonly set up as homeowners\u2019 associations, with residents adhering to legally binding bylaws. Yet with cohousing, there is one critical difference.\n\n\u201cWe are our own board, since most cohousing communities operate by consensus,\u201d said Karin Hoskin, executive director of the Cohousing Association of the United States and a resident of Wild Sage, a cohousing community in Boulder, Colo. Though typically not required, residents are expected, or at least encouraged, to attend the group dinners and pitch in where they feel most comfortable: maintaining the grounds, for example, or serving on committees. When it comes to finalizing decisions about maintaining common areas, or questions like noise levels in public spaces after certain hours, the entire community must agree. The objective, Ms. Hoskin said, was to regain a lost sense of community.\n\n\u201cI know all of my neighbors. If I need to borrow some eggs, I know which houses I can go to where they\u2019ll probably have eggs,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not home, there is a good chance I\u2019ll have a key to their house. It\u2019s really reminiscent of old-fashioned neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nCohousing can be traced to Copenhagen, where the first \u201cliving communities,\u201d or bofaellesskaber, opened in 1970. A decade later two architecture students, Charles Durrett and Kathryn McCamant, were on a year abroad at the University of Copenhagen. During Mr. Durrett\u2019s daily commute through mundane suburbs, he noticed one complex that stood out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPeople in this one development were always out there talking to each other, sitting at picnic tables drinking tea. There were children running from house to house, and people coming and going to this building, the common house, where nobody lived and apparently everybody lived,\u201d he recalled.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Durrett and Ms. McCamant later married and, in 1984, returned to Denmark to learn more about the concept. In 1988, they self-published a book on the topic, and three years later built America\u2019s first cohousing community, Muir Commons, in Davis, Calif. Since then, their Nevada City, Calif., firm, McCamant & Durrett Architects/The Cohousing Company, has designed 55 cohousing communities across the United States, with more in development.\n\nThe momentum for cohousing had been growing. The National Building Museum in Washington noted the recent \u201cboom in cohousing communities nationwide\u201d in a current exhibition. One reason for the boom is that cohousing construction is seen as a good investment, said Richard Jenkens, director of social impact initiatives at the National Cooperative Bank, a Washington lender that finances cohousing projects.\n\nSixty-two percent of people polled in a Cohousing Research Network survey last spring said that sale prices of cohousing units in their communities have been rising, according to an analyst for the network, Angela Sanguinetti. But, substantial down payments are not always required for prospective residents. Many developments offer units eligible for F.H.A. loans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some terrific examples of cohousing developments that incorporate a number of low-income units, as many as 20 to 40 percent,\u201d Mr. Jenkens said.\n\nStill, there are those for whom cohousing might not work.\n\n\u201cSome people feel that cohousing is too much togetherness,\u201d said the social scientist Bella DePaulo, who wrote about cohousing in her book, \u201cHow We Live Now: Redefining Home and Family in the 21st Century.\u201d The model is also not for those who bristle at the self-governing element, she added. Then there is cohousing\u2019s association with hippies.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cPeople immediately think communes, but cohousing is not a commune where everyone lives under one roof,\u201d Dr. DePaulo said.\n\nFor aging hippies and baby boomers, however, dedicated senior cohousing offers an alternative to a retirement home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a good aging-in-place or downsizing model for people in their 50s and early 60s who still have quite a bit of life ahead of them, but want to move out of the old family house because they want less maintenance,\u201d said Jim Leach, 77, a founder of Silver Sage Village, a cohousing community of mostly seniors in Boulder.\n\nCommunity living can also be a balm for the documented isolation and loneliness plaguing older Americans, which researchers say threatens public health. According to a 2010 AARP survey, social networks ease the loneliness that can follow the loss of a spouse, or family members\u2019 moving, Ms. Hoskin said.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t staying where they grew up anymore, and a huge trend among seniors is that they don\u2019t have their siblings or their kids around them because they\u2019ve gone away to university or moved out of state for a job.

That doesn't mean it's true or even that there has been any genuine wrongdoing \u2014 just that it's worth asking some very serious questions.\n\nFirst came a series of reports from the Journal about the payment made by Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. It most recently reported Thursday that Cohen created an LLC in Delaware \u2014 where LLCs don't have to disclose their managers \u2014 and used pseudonyms to facilitate the payment to Daniels.\n\nBy Friday, the magazine InTouch published what it said was a previously unpublished 2011 interview with Daniels in which she describes having sex with Trump in 2006, when he was newly married to Melania Trump, who is now first lady. What's perhaps most notable about the interview is how many of the details deal with things that weren't and aren't widely known about Trump. For instance, Daniels:\n\nMakes reference to Trump's bodyguard, \u201cKeith,\u201d being his gatekeeper for all of her contacts with Trump. She says of \u201cKeith\u201d that she \u201cmet [him] every time I saw [Trump]. Keith was always with him.\u201d Trump's longtime body man is Keith Schiller.\n\nAlso refers to another Trump aide, his secretary \u201cRhona.\u201d This is Rhona Graff, who had worked for the Trump Organization for more than three decades.\n\nMakes a few somewhat bizarre references to Trump's distaste for sharks. \u201cHe is obsessed with sharks,\u201d she said. \u201cTerrified of sharks. He was like, 'I donate to all these charities, and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.' \" She added at another point that they \u201cmoved to the sofa so he could get a better view of ' Shark Week.' \" Soon, reporters and those on social media had found other examples of Trump's anti-shark commentary.\n\n\"@KrisztinaO: @realDonaldTrump where we going???\" If our leaders don't get nuclear weapons under control, the sharks won't have us to eat! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2013\n\nSharks are last on my list - other than perhaps the losers and haters of the World! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2013\n\nSorry folks, I'm just not a fan of sharks - and don't worry, they will be around long after we are gone. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2013\n\nThis interview was reportedly conducted, mind you, before those 2013 tweets and before Trump was a much-covered presidential candidate whose personal life and longtime aides have been the subject of endless media coverage. For example, the first news-report mention of Schiller in relation to Trump came in October 2011, according to a Nexis search.\n\nSo if the story isn't based on actual interactions with Trump, then it's pretty clear Daniels did some real research to make it seem plausible.\n\nCohen has denied to the Journal that Trump and Daniels had any such encounter, and Cohen has also provided a statement with Daniels's name attached to it saying the same and denying she was ever paid \u201chush money.\u201d But Cohen hasn't denied making the $130,000 payment, and Daniels's on-the-record interview with InTouch would seem difficult to square with Cohen's denial attached to her name. She also was reportedly in talks with ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\u201d about going public during the campaign.\n\nThe most charitable interpretation of all of this would seem to be that someone very close to Trump paid a large sum of money to someone who was prepared to make a very serious allegation about the then-candidate. That doesn't make whatever she was about to say true, of course, but it does suggest that Cohen (and possibly Trump?) felt there was a good reason to give her that money. It's also worth asking why Cohen apparently wanted to keep the payment private, not to mention whose money it was.\n\nOf course, what if it were all true and Trump did engage in an affair with a porn star early in his marriage to Melania Trump? Would it necessarily change much of anything? It is widely known \u2014 and Trump has acknowledged \u2014 having cheated on his first wife, Ivana, with Marla Maples, who became his second wife. President Bill Clinton was not removed from office for his marital infidelity, and in fact most of his problems emanated from having lied about it rather than the actual deed.\n\nThe moral aspect of this would seem to have bigger implications for Trump's personal life and possibly for views of him ahead of his 2020 reelection campaign, and that makes it worth pursuing the truth. But the bigger question may be whether there was anything untoward or legally dicey about the payment, which we still don't know a ton about. And that's really what takes this story from tabloid fodder to real news.", "title": "The case for taking the Trump-Stormy Daniels affair saga seriously", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/20/the-case-for-taking-the-trump-stormy-daniels-affair-saga-seriously/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T12:00:21Z"}, {"textData": "Vice President Mike Pence speaks during a visit to Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2018.

(Photo: Steve Marcus, Las Vegas Sun via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Here's a look at some of the key takeaways from Vice President Pence's first year in office.\n\n1. Trump loyalty\n\nPence has been an unfailingly loyal No. 2, neither taking credit for administration actions nor apparently participating in leaking from multiple warring factions at the White House. In fact, his effusive praise of Trump has been much noted \u2013 and not often in a good way. In December, conservative columnist Michael Gerson called Pence \u201cthe cringing, fawning high priest of flunkiness.\u201d That came after a cabinet meeting at which Pence offered 14 separate commendations for Trump in less than three minutes, according to a Washington Post calculation..\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence wave to supporters at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Aug. 22, 2017. (Photo: Patrick Breen, The Arizona Republic-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\n2. Congressional role\n\nAs president of the Senate, Pence has already broken more ties than seven of his last nine predecessors, putting him in position to set a modern record. His first tie-breaking vote, to confirm Betsy DeVos as Education secretary, was the first time a vice president\u2019s vote was needed for a Cabinet nomination. Besides supplementing the Republicans' razor-thin margin in the Senate, Pence has been actively involved in legislative negotiations on health care, taxes and other issues, keeping in close contact with congressional leaders as well as an influential group of conservative lawmakers. Two high points were presiding over the Senate when lawmakers confirmed Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court and approved the tax package. A low point was Republican\u2019s failure to repeal Obamacare as they\u2019d been promising to do for years.\n\nSupreme Court Justice nominee, Neil Gorsuch is joined by Vice President Mike Pence, as they walk to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017. (Photo: Jose Luis Magana, AP)\n\n3. Russia investigation\n\nPence has not been interviewed by the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election. But he hasn\u2019t been unscathed by the still-developing story. Some of his past statements have come back to bite him \u2014 including his assertions that former national security adviser Michael Flynn didn't discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the transition, his explanation for why FBI Director James Comey was fired, and his dismissing as \u201cbizarre rumors\u201d the suggestion that there were contacts during the campaign between Russian officials and Trump associates. He\u2019s faced the charge that if he was not lying when he made his comments, then he was an \u201cout of the loop dupe.\u201d\n\n4. Media attention\n\nThe Washington Post in March revived a comment Pence made in 2002 that he wouldn\u2019t eat alone with a woman other than his wife and didn\u2019t attend events featuring alcohol unless she was there. His version of the \u201cBilly Graham rule\u201d that some Protestant Christians follow quickly became known as the \"Pence rule.\" Debate over whether the rule guides good behavior or is demeaning to women intensified after sexual harassment allegations exploded in the entertainment, media and other worlds. Pence also sparked intense debate when he walked out of an Indianapolis Colts game after some players on the opposing team knelt during the national anthem. Some praised Pence, who said he wouldn\u2019t \u201cdignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, and our national anthem.\" Critics called it a pre-planned political stunt at taxpayers' expense.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, stand at attention during the playing of the national anthem at the Indianapolis Colts game against the San Francisco 49ers on Oct. 8, 2017. The Pences walked out a short while later to protest kneeling by some players. (Photo: Michael Conroy/AP)\n\n5. Special assignments\n\nAfter Trump claimed without evidence that at least 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election, he put Pence in charge of a commission to investigate voter fraud. But Trump disbannded the commission this month in the midst of multiple lawsuits against it and resistance by states to turning over voter data. Pence still heads a revived space commission that had been dormant since the George H.W. Bush administration, signalllng the administration will emphasize the space program. Notably, Pence announced NASA would return to the moon after the Obama administration had decided on other missions.\n\n6. Liaison to social conservatives\n\nSelected as Trump\u2019s running mate in part for his strong ties to social conservatives, Pence remains a key administration ally for that constituency. He frequently addresses religious groups, collaborates with movement leaders and \u2013 days after being sworn in \u2013 became the highest-ranked administration official to appear in person at the annual \u201cMarch for Life\u201d anti-abortion rally.\n\nVice President Pence addresses a rally on the National Mall before the start of the 44th annual March for Life on Jan. 27, 2017. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)\n\n7. Foreign travel\n\nPence made multiple trips abroad, often sparking headlines on how his mission was to reassure allies about Trump\u2019s commitment to the region. He also made a surprise trip to Afghanistan in December, a trip notable in part because Trump has not visited an active U.S. combat zone. On the one-year anniversary of being sworn in, Pence was on a trip to the Middle East that includes a visit to Israel. (Pence was a strong supporter of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a move that sparked protests in the region in December when Pence was originally scheduled to visit.) Michael Wolff's controversial book on the Trump Administration suggested a reason for Pence\u2019s foreign trips. After White House chief strategist Steve Bannon observed a \u201chapless Pence,\u201d in a lot of \u201cwrong meetings\u201d regarding the Russia investigation, Wolff wrote, he helped get Pence \u2014 \u201cour fallback guy\u201d \u2014 out around the world to look like a vice president.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence arrives to speak to troops in a hangar at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan on Thursday, Dec. 21, 2017. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AP)\n\n8. Political activity\n\nPence raised eyebrows by starting his own fundraising committee, an unusual move for a vice president. Created to help congressional candidates \u2014 through donations and campaign appearances \u2014 the political action committee also helps Pence build his own brand and strengthen already strong ties with Congress. He plans to be particularly active in this year\u2019s midterm elections. But Pence called \"disgraceful and offensive\" an August New York Times article suggesting he's positioning himself to run for president in 2020 if Trump does not.\n\n9. Hoosier influence\n\nIn addition to the Hoosiers Pence brought with him to work in his office, Indiana boasts many other people in influential positions. That's particularly true at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which former Eli Lilly executive Alex Azar is on track to lead. Former Indiana health care consultant Seema Verma heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And former Indiana health commissioner Jerome Adams is the surgeon general.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2F02Bmj", "title": "A look at Vice President Pence's first year in office: key takeaways", "sourceId": "usa-today", "sourceName": "USA Today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/20/look-vice-president-pences-first-year-office-key-takeaways/1048778001/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T12:00:09Z"}, {"textData": "The visitors and victims were all colors and backgrounds.

Smith, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOver the winter holidays, my family and I visited the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in lower Manhattan. Though it had opened in 2014, and we live in nearby New Jersey, I\u2019d never had much interest in going. After all, what else was there to learn? The attacks were documented as they happened: Like millions of others, I watched the towers come down in real time on TV; videos of the event are all over the web; books recount both the moment-by-moment drama of the tragedy as well the ancient historical forces that led to it.\n\nBut the museum is powerfully stunning: It does a great job memorializing the horror of the day, and putting it into historical, architectural, and religious context. What struck me \u2014 and moved me \u2014 the most was the purely democratic, mixed-up, we're-all-in-this-together nature of the place. On the day we were there, the museum was filled with primarily non-white visitors (of many hues, languages, religions and dress codes). And those who were killed that day, and honored beautifully in photographs, video, and narrative, were also from all backgrounds, nations, religion, linguistic groups and any other way you can slice and dice our species into categories.\n\nMore: I have a Cadillac health insurance plan in a land of jalopies. How is that fair?\n\nMore: With an economy this good, why is Trump's approval rating so bad?\n\nThere we all were, together, in hushed reverence, gazing at the charred hunks of fire engines, the twisted remains of what were once great steel girders, and most of all, the faces of the 2,983 victims of the attacks. All those faces \u2014 any one of them could have been your brother, your neighbor, your girlfriend, your cousin, your college sweetheart, your pharmacist or doctor or dry cleaner or 7th grade math teacher: photo after photo in room after room built in the footprint of the south tower. It\u2019s like leafing through the pages of a giant yearbook, so the faces you\u2019re gazing at are as large as they would be in the mirror, or larger. Lily white? Not so much. The nearly 3,000 who died from incendiary hatred seemed to be, like the museum visitors, from all walks of life and all manner of human genotype.\n\nWhat I thought was: Thank you, America, for doing such a good job. Really: My heart swelled with pride and gratitude, something it hasn\u2019t felt much in the current political climate. Like many other American crossroads \u2014 hospitals, the YMCA, airports \u2014 the 9/11 Memorial & Museum is a living breathing testament to how much better this country is than the you-versus-me rhetoric and insanity now spewing out the hate camps and echoed in inflammatory rhetoric by the president.\n\nYou could argue that New York City is hardly representative of heartland America, that it\u2019s uniquely diverse, unusually cosmopolitan, American only by virtue of its geographical placement. Except that New York isn\u2019t alone in its population mixing. Houston is more than 40% Latino; Los Angeles is home to an even larger percentage of Latinos, and is more than 10% Asian and almost 10% African-American. And along with its African American and white citizens, Elgin, Ill. is home to a rapidly growing Laotian community. All of these places are \u201creal\u201d America.\n\nMore: President Trump's first year made me rethink my American government class\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nLove it or hate it, New York is and always has been the harbinger of things to come. Remember when the only place you could get a decent bagel was in New York? Now you can get them pretty much anywhere, including in Baton Rouge, La., where my family and I lived for years. Ditto sushi, French baguettes and emergency room doctors from Pakistan.\n\nOn the morning of 9/11, I was driving down Government Street in Baton Rouge when the music I was listening to was interrupted by the news that an airplane had struck one of the twin towers. An hour later, I picked up my kids from school. By the end of the day, amidst rumors that the Louisiana-Texas petrochemical corridor would be the terrorists\u2019 next target, a group of citizens had arranged round-the-clock volunteers to act as security guards for the city\u2019s several Lebanese, Persian and Halal restaurants. Other volunteers waited in line for hours to donate blood. Still others held prayer vigils for peace.\n\nAnd this in a red city named after a red stick in a red state.\n\nBecause, folks, when the chips are down, real Americans don\u2019t rabble-rouse, tweet, threaten or chant Nazi slogans. Nor do they use the memory of 9/11 to stir up divisiveness and hatred. They roll up their sleeves and get to work.\n\nJennifer Anne Moses, a writer for numerous publications, is the author of four books, including Bagels and Grits: A Jew on the Bayou, and Visiting Hours.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

(Andreas Arnold/dpa via AP, file) (Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 The leaders of Germany\u2019s Social Democrats made a final push Saturday to try and convince party members to approve opening talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives on forming a new coalition government, saying it was the best option left on the table.\n\nThe center-left party, which has governed with Merkel since 2013, was battered in September\u2019s election, falling to a post-war low of 20.5 percent support. Leader Martin Schulz had vowed not to enter another coalition, saying his party would regroup in opposition.\n\nBut he reconsidered after Merkel\u2019s attempts to form a coalition with two smaller parties failed.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to a party vote in Bonn on Sunday whether to open negotiations, based upon a 28-page agreement on issues hashed out a week ago between the Social Democrats, Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, and her Bavarian-only sister Christian Social Union.\n\nSchulz and other leaders face firm resistance, led by the party\u2019s youth wing, driven by fears that concessions needed to form another so-called grand coalition of the country\u2019s biggest parties will further alienate the Social Democrats\u2019 base and lead to a further erosion of support. Many have also expressed concerns that if a coalition is formed, that would leave the anti-migrant nationalist Alternative for Germany the country\u2019s largest opposition party.\n\nEven if negotiations are approved, party members still need to also sign off on whatever coalition agreement is concluded.\n\nBut if they vote against negotiations, that leaves only the possibilities that Merkel will form a minority government \u2014 which she has indicated she doesn\u2019t want \u2014 or a new election.\n\nShould it come to another election, the latest polls suggest the results would be very similar to those in September \u2014 with the Social Democrats possibly faring even a little worse \u2014 creating the same situation again.\n\nSenior Social Democratic lawmaker Andrea Nahles, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper she was confident coalition negotiations would be approved, while warning the party would be put on the defensive in any new election campaign.\n\n\u201cPlease consider what consequences a failure of this government option will have,\u201d she said. \u201cNew elections are fraught with many risks and side effects... Some believe that the Social Democrats can only renew itself in opposition but that is a fallacy.\u201d\n\nRight now, it\u2019s thought that about a third of the delegates voting Sunday are against opening negotiations with Merkel, a third are for, while a third are undecided.\n\nComplicating matters, two of the biggest voting blocs, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, are considering only voting for opening negotiations on the condition that Schulz push for more concessions on labor, health and migration policies with Merkel\u2019s conservatives, according to a report in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.\n\nThe Union bloc, however, has indicated it will not agree to any changes to the document already negotiated.\n\nDeputy party leader Olaf Scholz, mayor of the city-state of Hamburg, urged party members to vote for opening formal negotiations and break the political deadlock in Germany, saying Europe was watching.\n\n\u201cThe decision of this party congress is important for Germany, but affects things far beyond our border,\u201d he told the dpa news agency.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Saurabh Das, FILE/Associated Press)\n\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Gabon says a major trafficking ring that smuggled six tons of ivory out of the country in 2017 has been dismantled, in a victory against poachers who have killed large numbers of forest elephants in the Central African country.\n\nThe Chadian head of the syndicate, Abdoulaye Mohamoud Ibrahim, and eight accomplices, including his wife, son and daughter-in-law, were arrested on Nov. 1 after a two-year investigation assisted by Interpol and French law enforcement, Gabon\u2019s national parks agency said. The ring\u2019s \u201cmoneyman\u201d was arrested three weeks later.\n\nThe arrests were not immediately announced because the investigation was continuing and suspects would have gone \u201cunderground\u201d if there had been publicity, the parks service director, Lee White, said in an email to The Associated Press. He said the suspects could be imprisoned for at least 10 years if convicted on organized crime charges.\n\nNGOs that help to make arrests tend to publicize them \u201cin part to put pressure on the prosecutors and judges to try the case in a transparent manner and in part as a fundraising strategy,\u201d White said. \u201cWhen we make arrests it inevitably leads to new intelligence that allows us to work our way up to the kingpins.\u201d\n\nGabon has Africa\u2019s biggest population of forest elephants, which are harder to monitor and count than savannah elephants because they live in dense vegetation. However, a Duke University study released a year ago revealed the toll of poaching, concluding that the elephant population in Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 National Park in northeast Gabon had dropped by about 80 percent, or more than 25,000 elephants, between 2004 and 2014.\n\nWell-protected elephant populations are recovering in some parks in Gabon, including along the Atlantic coast, according to White.\n\nGabon has deployed the military in some areas to protect wildlife.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The government announced this month that growth reached 6.9 percent in 2017, but economists generally don\u2019t expect the economy to maintain that pace. The World Bank predicts a 6.4 percent expansion this year.\n\nPolicymakers in China are facing the difficult task of overhauling the economy\u2019s growth model to rely more on household spending, which remains low compared with levels in other large economies. Traditionally, China has been propelled by high investment, but that has saddled the economy with too many factories in industries such as steel and a mounting burden of debt, now at about 260 percent of national output.\n\nPhoto\n\nMost economists do not expect China to tumble into a financial crisis, like other debt-heavy emerging economies have in the past. But Beijing\u2019s efforts to control the problem by curtailing the expansion of credit could dampen overall economic growth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChetan Ahya, global co-head of economics at Morgan Stanley, considers China one of the outside risks facing the world economy. Though he expects that Beijing will tread cautiously on tackling debt, tightening credit too rapidly, he warned, could spark a sharper slowdown in domestic demand. \u201cYou want to ensure that confidence on growth is not collapsing very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce confidence goes down, you tend to see all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the only danger lurking on economists\u2019 radar. The recovery has been greased by the extremely supportive policies of the Federal Reserve in the United States and the central banks of the eurozone and Japan. But now, with improved growth, central bankers are expected to reduce these stimulus efforts, a move that could lead to higher interest rates.\n\nUnwinding these programs, which included the buying of bonds on a massive scale, will also be tricky, as any surprises could spook investors and depress prices of stocks and other assets. Economists generally say they do not anticipate that central banks will tighten enough to significantly drag on growth in the near term. But an unexpected jump in inflation, beyond current expectations, could prod them to constrain money more rapidly, possibly posing a bigger threat to growth.\n\nConcerns remain as well about a disruption to international trade, which would be especially damaging at the moment, because strong exports have boosted the current rebound. The worries center mainly on the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to renegotiate pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement and possibly take a tougher line on trade with China.\n\n\u201cThe White House has become a risk factor,\u201d said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at the research firm Capital Economics in London.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat worries economists more, however, are long-term problems that continue to plague the world economy. Through global growth has improved, it still lags behind the pace before the financial crisis, when it increased at around 4 percent or more each year.\n\nMeager gains in productivity are probably the biggest headache for economists. Without stronger improvements, sustaining economic growth becomes far more difficult. Economists recommend greater investment in infrastructure, especially in the developing world, which can lower business costs and enhance efficiency, and education and job training, to increase the skills of workers.\n\nAnother issue is widening income inequality within national economies. Not all segments of society are benefiting as they probably should from improved global economic performance.\n\nEven with unemployment rates plunging \u2014 in Japan, for instance, to a remarkable 2.7 percent \u2014 wage growth has still been tepid compared with past periods of economic expansion. Because poor families tend to spend additional income more readily than rich ones, the concentration of wealth at the top could be depriving economies of consumer spending.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Henry of HSBC said she worried that the income amassed by the world\u2019s wealthiest might be getting invested in bonds, property or other assets rather than investments that could enhance productivity. \u201cAt the moment, it doesn\u2019t look like the savings of higher earners are going into productive investment,\u201d she said. Income inequality \u201cmay already be starting to have a negative impact on growth.\u201d\n\nDistorted labor markets, too, need fixing. Some countries, including India and parts of the Middle East, have labor laws that are so rigid that they discourage employers from increasing staff, condemning many workers to informal and often poorly paid jobs. Making it easier and less costly for managers to hire and fire would probably increase incomes and improve the productivity of labor.\n\nMr. Devarajan of the World Bank worries that the robust economy may lead to complacency and delay such critical economic reforms. \u201cThe time to act may be now,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the costs of not doing it could be very high.\u201d", "title": "World Economic Forum: With Davos Approaching, the Global Economy Is Surging, but Growth Could Stall", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/business/davos-global-economy-growth.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T11:00:23Z"}, {"textData": "Amid his maddening eccentricities, there is a deli-thin silver lining. While he clearly isn't stable, America still seems to be on track.\n\nPresident Trump (Photo: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOur current lexicon is loaded with phrases that do damage to the very idea they're meant to express. If someone leans over to you and whispers \"trust me,\" there's obviously a reason you shouldn't be doing so. When a friend begins a sentence with, \"I'm not racist, but\u2026\" there's a 100% chance that dude is about to say something racist. If a food product prominently boasts that it has \"Zero Trans Fats,\" you can bet it contains enough non-trans fats to kill an elite athlete dead on the spot.\n\nLike manna from heaven, President Trump has gifted us with a new contradictory term bound to attach itself to his tenure like a moray eel. In a tweet defending his own cognitive abilities, the president of the United States felt it necessary to declare himself a \"very stable genius,\" a defensive term that could only be crafted by someone who was neither stable nor a genius. In fact, the injection of \"very stable genius\" into the national vernacular only served to reinforce the popular perception of Trump's brain \u2014 that it is a cavernous space populated only by Electoral College results and beauty pageant contestant measurements.\n\nMore: Despite Trump's bigotry, America needs more African immigrants\n\nMore: Do Hollywood's sexual predators deserve the artistic death penalty?\n\nYet amid Trump's maddening eccentricities, there is a deli-thin silver lining to be found. While Trump clearly isn't stable, America still seems to be on track.\n\nLast week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its fastest ever 1,000-point jump, hitting 25,000 for the first time in history. By the end of 2017, the U.S. unemployment rate had fallen to 4.1%, down from 4.7% when Trump took office. Middle-class taxpayers just received a large tax cut allowing them to spend more of their own money.\n\nAnd yet with all this good news, Trump's approval rating remains mired in the 30's, a result of his superhuman dedication to insufferable boobery. At this point, this is actually Trump's best play; if he leans in to the \"lovable imbecile\" persona, he might almost seem sympathetic. Nobody can be this spectacularly idiotic on purpose.\n\nThis is where the American system of government shows its true genius. The framers actually considered what would happen if a Trump-like figure were to take office, and famously proposed shared governance to prevent the whole country from going belly-up. In Federalist #10, James Madison (\"Lame James\" in the president's parlance) warned that \"Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm,\" suggesting separating powers to control the influence of factions.\n\nIt is these disparate powers that landed a tax cut on Trump's desk and handed him a solidly conservative Supreme Court justice. State and local governments keep humming along, making sure roads are repaired and schools are funded. While Trump keeps feeding it Big Macs and Diet Coke, the finely tuned American engine keeps moving forward.\n\nBut the fact that America can still thrive with someone who is neither stable nor genius at the helm does create problems for the future. It could have the effect of devaluing future elections; if someone as obnoxious as Donald Trump can hold the highest office in the land, why should we take presidential elections seriously anymore?\n\nMore: Trump smeared my son's birthplace in his X-rated rant. Parents need help\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThis attitude has already surfaced among Democrats, who in response to the Republican pick of an unqualified billionaire television star by for president \u2026 considered picking their own unqualified billionaire television star for president. After her inspirational speech at the Golden Globes awards, TV host/movie producer/actress Oprah Winfrey triggered an avalanche of pleas for her to run against Trump in 2020.\n\nOprah is a godlike figure in entertainment for good reason, having been an inspirational part of peoples' lives for over 30 years. But if the past few months have taught us anything, nobody really knows what celebrities are like in private, much less what they think about public education, immigration, taxation or a host of other issues. On her show, Oprah routinely outsources expertise to anyone with the word \"Doctor\" before their names, foisting all manner of medicinal and psychological quackery on the American populace.\n\nInstead of picking each new president solely as an extreme reaction to the preceding president, America will once again have to get serious. But it's a feature of our Constitution, not a bug, that (at least in the short term) a clueless controversialist can hold the office. \"America\" is a product of its people, not its president.\n\nTrust me.\n\nChristian Schneider is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and a columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Despite the fact that Mr. Ala\u00efa was 82, he had not exactly strategized for the future, and there had never really been any discussions of formal succession.\n\n\u201cHe thought he was eternal,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said. But while not focused on the mechanics of the house, he was \u201cvery concerned with legacy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTo that end, he and his partner, the painter Christoph von Weyhe, created the Azzedine Ala\u00efa Association in 2007, a nonprofit that will be administered by Ms. Sozzani, Olivier Saillard (the former director of the Palais Galliera, one of Paris\u2019s two fashion museums), and Mr. von Weyhe. That took place at the same time that a majority stake in the company was being sold to Richemont.\n\n\u201cWe were reorganizing his life, and he wanted to protect his work and archives,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said. According to Mr. von Weyhe, Mr. Ala\u00efa set aside enough money to endow the association, which is in the process of applying for more formal foundation status.\n\nMr. Ala\u00efa had been saving his own work since the 1980s, and he has been collecting the work of designers he admired for even longer, including pieces from Charles James, Paul Poiret, Vionnet, Chanel, Madame Gr\u00e8s and many others. Neither Ms. Sozzani nor Mr. Saillard could venture a guess as to how many pieces there were, but together they occupied five floors and approximately 14,760 square feet in Mr. Ala\u00efa\u2019s compound on rue de la Verrerie. To create more room there, a portion of the archive is being moved to a building near rue de la R\u00e9publique, which has an additional 9,840 square feet.\n\n\u201cI never saw such archives in my life,\u201d said Mr. Saillard, who is effectively the association\u2019s curator. \u201cHe has the most important private collection devoted to the history of fashion. For 20 years I used to see him at auctions, and we curators were all very jealous because he always bought the masterpiece we wanted, and he always refused to show them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just clothes. Mr. Ala\u00efa collected furniture from designers including Pierre Paulin, Jean Prouv\u00e9, Shiro Kuramata and Marc Newson, as well as books. It is the clothes, however, and the patterns, fabrics, buttons and sketches \u2014 the record of his creative process \u2014 that will form the basis of the continuing life of the house.\n\n\u201cHe kept everything,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said.\n\n\u201cI think what they are doing is actually spot on because they are continuing his work and his legacy by showing what he worked on but never showed,\u201d said Ikram Goldman, of the Chicago boutique Ikram, who has sold Mr. Ala\u00efa\u2019s clothes to Michelle Obama and other clients since opening in 2001. \u201cThese days there is so much chopping and changing of designers that you can often lose the essence of a house, but his essence was working and reworking his technique \u2014 not responding to the trends of the moment.\u201d\n\nThat is part of what Mr. Saillard is hoping will be conveyed by the exhibition, which will include about 38 pieces of Ala\u00efa from the 1980s to today, all in black and white. The message is not about looking back but rather, Mr. Saillard said, \u201cthe timelessness of his work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a leather dress there from the 1980s and you could wear it today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Prouv\u00e9: The chair is as great today as it ever was. The dress is as perfect.\u201d\n\nDaniella Vitale, the chief executive of Barneys New York, where Ala\u00efa is among the top 10 brands, said that it remained committed to the brand. Last year, she pointed out, Ala\u00efa created a special collection of pieces from the archives to celebrate his 35 years with the store, pieces that \u201chadn\u2019t been seen for a long time, and they all sold very well.\u201d\n\nThe staff of the house is intact, and in many ways it is functioning much as it did before. Everyone still eats together every day in the kitchen. There is, Mr. von Weyhe said, a \u201cfeeling of solidarity.\u201d Mr. Saillard\u2019s word is \u201cmission.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe difference is where they work. When Mr. Ala\u00efa died, his friends closed the door to his personal studio, as well as his apartment on the floor above, to preserve it exactly as he left it, down to \u201cthe last glass he touched,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said. His designers and assistants migrated across the courtyard to other sample rooms and ateliers.\n\nThe idea, she said, is that at some point they will open both floors to the public, and they will become a museum of sorts. (Mr. Ala\u00efa, who rarely left his studio and was famous for working through the night, slept in a Prouv\u00e9 glass gas station that he had installed in his apartment, and he had a vertical garden in his bathroom.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis staff and colleagues are also creating a bookstore, which will be housed in the former sale shop of the house, with books on Mr. Ala\u00efa, the designers he loved and catalogs from the exhibitions he hosted in his gallery, including shows on the Syrian poet Adonis and the British painter Richard Wentworth.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want money or glory, but he wanted his work and the work of designers he admired to be available to the next generation,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said.\n\nThe main floor of the headquarters will remain a working store. Ms. Goldman said she expects the response to the clothes to be as robust as ever. \u201cWe will definitely continue to buy it, and we will definitely continue to sell it,\u201d she said. None of the brand\u2019s plans for growth are being put off.

The full interview will be broadcast Sunday.\n\nThe comments undermine the position of some Brexit supporters who want to regain control of the U.K.\u2019s borders and shun the oversight of European courts while retaining access to the single market.\n\nIt will also dash the hopes of some in Britain who thought Macron might be more flexible than German Chancellor Angela Merkel in negotiating a deal. Macron\u2019s influence within the EU is on the rise as Merkel\u2019s position weakens following an election in September that eroded her power base. Merkel has still not been able to cobble together a coalition government even after months of talks with other political parties.\n\nMacron\u2019s comments echo those he made during a meeting Thursday in which he and British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged closer cooperation on defense and border security after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Macron said the U.K.\u2019s financial services industry can\u2019t keep its coveted access to the EU market unless the country continues playing by EU rules.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you decide not to join these preconditions, it\u2019s not a full access,\u201d Macron told the BBC.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is not to make people think, or believe, that it\u2019s possible to have\u201d your cake and eat it, he said, accepting Marr\u2019s suggestion for the last five words.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWith airstrikes and artillery fire, Turkey on Saturday defied U.S. appeals and opened a long-anticipated offensive on \u00adAfrin, an enclave in Syria for Kurdish militias backed by the United States.\n\nTurkish officials have framed the offensive as part of a wider battle against Kurdish separatists, known as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, in Turkey\u2019s southeast. Turkey also fears any gains in strength by the Syrian Kurds, whose territory runs along some of Turkey\u2019s southern border.\n\nBut the United States has opted to back the Syrian Kurds as proxy fighters against the Islamic State and as a buffer to keep the militants from trying to reclaim territory.\n\nThe military action immediately raised concerns that it could spark conflicts among the assortment of foreign military powers present, in proximity, across northern Syria. They include Turkey, Russia and the United States. All have the Islamic State as a common foe, but, individually, they back different factions among the various armed groups in Syria.\n\nThe latest flash point also highlighted the shifting disputes and conflicting agendas that have complicated any efforts toward ending nearly seven years of conflict in Syria. The Turkish military action came amid intensifying violence in the northern Syrian province of Idlib, where Syrian government forces are on the offensive against al-Qaeda-aligned rebels in the east of the province.\n\nRecent statements by U.S. military officials about plans to train border security forces that would protect a Kurdish enclave in Syria also provoked Turkey\u2019s ire.\n\n\u201cWe are taking these steps to ensure our own national security,\u201d President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in comments carried by the semiofficial Anadolu agency.\n\nYet Turkish incursions could carry risks. The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had warned that it was prepared to fire on Turkish warplanes in the event of an attack on Afrin.\n\n[U.S. gives mixed signals on Kurdish force as Turkey escalates pressure]\n\nA Syrian government offensive is causing one of the worst surges in population displacement since Syria\u2019s civil war began. More than 212,000 people have fled fighting around Idlib in the past month, many of them sleeping in the open as temperatures plunge and rain drenches makeshift campsites, according to the United Nations.\n\nOn Saturday, hours after the announcement of the airstrikes, Turkey said it had struck more than 100 positions belonging to Kurdish fighters. The number of casualties was not immediately clear. The airstrikes followed days of intense Turkish artillery fire on Kurdish positions, according to residents in Afrin.\n\nIn a statement, the U.S.-backed Kurdish force, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, warned that the Turkish offensive \u201cthreatens to breathe new life into Daesh,\u201d using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State militant group.\n\nThe Trump administration, in urging NATO-ally Turkey not to attack, had made a similar argument, saying it would distract from the ongoing battles against Islamic State militants in their remaining strongholds in Syria. There are roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria.\n\nRussia, which backs Assad\u2019s government, said it was watching developments \u201cwith concern\u201d and called on the warring sides to \u201cexercise mutual restraint.\u201d Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that an unspecified number of Russian troops had been moved out of the Afrin area and redeployed.\n\nMuch about the Turkish offensive, which the government dubbed \u201cOperation Olive Branch,\u201d remained unclear Saturday, including whether it would be accompanied by a substantial push by Turkish ground forces and allied rebel factions.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that no one knows what they intend to do,\u201d said Aaron Stein, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAfrin will be hostile to a Turkish-backed force patrolling from permanent garrisons. The YPG in the area can retreat to the mountains for protection,\u201d he said, referring to the Syrian Kurdish militia that controls Afrin.\n\nThe offensive probably was prompted in part by Turkish concerns that Russia and the United States planned to broker a reconciliation between Syria\u2019s government and the Syrian Kurdish forces. \u201cThis is anathema to Turkey for obvious reasons,\u201d Stein said. \u201cSo they are making a statement.\u201d\n\nLoveluck reported from London.

The athletes will compete in women\u2019s ice hockey, figure skating, short-track speedskating, cross-country skiing and Alpine skiing. The two countries had already agreed on Wednesday to form the unified hockey team, the first inter-Korean team ever fielded at the Olympics.\n\nThe Koreas have also agreed that their delegations will march together during the opening ceremony.

But Mr. Moon\u2019s critics, including much of South Korea\u2019s generally conservative news media, have argued that the North will use the Olympics as a propaganda opportunity, to try to weaken international resolve over enforcing sanctions against the North for its nuclear program.\n\nSouth Korean officials have insisted they would ensure that the North Korean delegates kept political propaganda out of their activities in the South. But the musicians and other performers being sent by Pyongyang, like any North Korean artist allowed to appear overseas, will have been well-trained in propagandizing for the country\u2019s authoritarian regime.\n\nNorth Korea had announced that its advance team would be headed by Hyon Song-wol, a singer who leads the Moranbong Band, said to be a favorite of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Under Mr. Kim\u2019s rule, the band has enlivened the North\u2019s propaganda-heavy pop music scene, sporting short skirts and performing American pop standards like \u201cMy Way\u201d and the \u201cRocky\u201d theme song.\n\nMs. Hyon herself has received outsize media attention in South Korea, where some news outlets have speculated \u2014 with no apparent evidence \u2014 that she was once Mr. Kim\u2019s girlfriend, a theory dismissed by North Korea analysts in the South. Mr. Kim\u2019s wife, Ri Sol-ju, is herself a former member of a pop band.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen reports linking Ms. Hyon to Mr. Kim first emerged years ago, North Korea called them \u201can unpardonable hideous provocation hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership.\u201d Some South Korean news outlets have continued to refer to Ms. Hyon in recent days as Mr. Kim\u2019s former girlfriend, and some analysts said on Saturday that the advance team\u2019s visit might have been canceled in protest.\n\nMs. Hyon was at the border village of Panmunjom for talks on Monday, when North Korea agreed to send a 140-member arts troupe to the South for concerts in Seoul and Gangneung, an Olympic venue on the east coast, during the Winter Games. Ms. Hyon was widely expected to lead the troupe.\n\nShe first gained international attention in 2013, when news reports in South Korea and Japan claimed that she had been executed on Mr. Kim\u2019s orders. But she later appeared in public wearing an army colonel\u2019s insignia and thanking Mr. Kim for his \u201cheavenly trust and warm care\u201d of the Moranbong Band. In October, Ms. Hyon was elected to the ruling Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s Central Committee as an alternate member.\n\nIn 2015, Ms. Hyon led the Moranbong Band to Beijing for a performance meant as a gesture of friendship between the two countries\u2019 Communist governments. But just hours before the performance was to begin, the band packed up and returned home.\n\nNeither government has explained what happened.

She began writing a series of three well-received novels, the first of which, \u201cEighteen Acres,\u201d told the story of the first female president and her controversial and polarizing running mate, also a woman. (From the book: \u201cShe was loud, tacky, and rude. She seemed to calculate the least presidential approach to every situation and pursue it with vigor.\u201d) More important, in 2013 she signed on as a regular contributor to \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nEarly on, Ms. Wallace seemed an awkward fit, especially compared with her voluble and more experienced colleagues. The show\u2019s co-host Mika Brzezinski, who watched Ms. Wallace\u2019s growth, said she felt that \u201cover the course of the time that she was on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 what I saw was Nicolle learning to have fun being on TV.\u201d\n\nMs. Wallace doesn\u2019t recall having growing pains as a panelist \u2014 \u201cI have never engaged in any self-examination as it pertains to television,\u201d she said \u2014 but she does acknowledge that her very first appearance on the show, as a senior adviser to the McCain-Palin campaign, had the potential to be contentious.\n\n\u201cThat was certainly an awkward job to have, to be speaking for Palin who was internally at war with me,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, when I first showed up on that show, it was often to spar with all of the other guests about Sarah Palin and McCain. But I always felt welcome and comfortable on that show. And one of the hallmarks of that show is that everyone is given all the space and time and latitude to be themselves.\u201d\n\nSoon after being added to \u201cMorning Joe\u201d as a regular panelist, Ms. Wallace added another TV job to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, joining \u201cThe View\u201d in 2014 to replace the combative Elisabeth Hasselbeck as the resident Republican. It was not a success.\n\nMs. Wallace said that ABC executives let her go for \u201cnot being Republican enough\u201d and that she learned of her dismissal from her fellow sacked colleague, Rosie Perez, who read about it in Variety. (The producers of the show reportedly offered her the chance to return as an occasional contributor, but she declined.)\n\nThough Ms. Wallace had worked with ABC News on special events, she made sure that her \u201cView\u201d contract let her keep a place as a contributor to \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d After her dismissal, NBC and MSNBC offered her a job, and within a month she was filing the first of her reports for \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver the course of the 2016 campaign, executives, including her now-executive producer Patrick Burkey, raised her on-air profile. She conducted candid, hourlong interviews with Jeb Bush, her former boss, and Chris Christie, then the New Jersey governor, after both had left the race. In the latter interview, Gov. Christie acknowledged that he hoped to be picked as Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, a spot that ultimately went to Mike Pence. \u201cI\u2019m a competitive person, so I\u2019m not going to say it won\u2019t bother me if I\u2019m not selected,\u201d Mr. Christie told Ms. Wallace. \u201cOf course it bothers you a little bit, because if you\u2019re a competitive person like I am and you\u2019re used to winning like I am, again, you don\u2019t like coming in second.

Her public breaking point came after Mr. Trump\u2019s strident and often angry acceptance speech for the Republican nomination in Cleveland. On air with Tom Brokaw and the NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt after the speech, Ms. Wallace said, \u201cThe Republican Party that I worked for for 20 years died in this room tonight.\u201d\n\n\u2018I Can\u2019t Explain Why They All Talk\u2019\n\n\u201cThe idea for the show was very much mine,\u201d Ms. Wallace said of her initial pitch to Mr. Griffin.

Ms. Wallace will raise her voice in reaction to clips, and doesn\u2019t withhold her indignation.

She laughs easily and strikes a tone between sarcasm and outrage over the actions of the institution she once served. Her guests joke with one another.

China\u2019s expanding military and an increasingly aggressive Russia are among the U.S. military\u2019s top national security priorities, the Pentagon said Friday. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press)\n\nA newly released Pentagon strategy document proposes a new vision of America\u2019s national security priorities \u2014 one in which competition with China and Russia is more important to the United States than the fight against international terrorism.\n\nAfter almost two decades of a \u201cwar on terror\u201d that came at huge expense but often had few tangible benefits, such a strategy would mark a noteworthy change in the way the United States conducts its foreign policy. However, the new strategy also raises a question: Do American voters agree?\n\nPerhaps not. A number of polls conducted over the past year show that Americans remain deeply concerned about the threat posed by international terrorism, while they appear to be underwhelmed by the risks posed by a rising China or a belligerent Russia. That disconnect between U.S. voters and the U.S. national security apparatus may become an issue down the road.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy was unveiled Friday morning at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. Speaking to reporters, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis explained that the document, which calls for a sustained financial investment in the military to overcome \u201ca period of strategic atrophy,\u201d reflects the real priorities for the United States at this moment in time.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to prosecute the campaign against terrorists, but great power competition \u2014 not terrorism \u2014 is now the primary focus of U.S. national security,\u201d Mattis said.\n\nBeijing and Moscow are seen as the primary rivals. In its text, the National Defense Strategy states that \u201clong-term strategic competitions with China and Russia\u201d are the \u201cprinciple priorities\u201d for the Defense Department. North Korea and Iran were listed as \u201crogue regimes\u201d that the United States would work to deter.\n\nThe shift in priorities detailed in the National Defense Strategy reflect concerns in the national security community about China and Russia\u2019s foreign policy ambitions. At the same time, it may also be a reflection of the idea that international terrorist groups like the Islamic State have had their capabilities seriously diminished over the past year and that they do not pose the same level of threat that they were once thought to.\n\nNotably, a report released by Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Center on Thursday showed that there was a global drop in terrorist attacks in 2017. Notably, there appears to have been a significant drop in the number of terrorism-related civilian deaths last year \u2014 if you look at the average for the previous five years, it was a drop of 45 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this shift, there is little sign that the U.S. public is more concerned about the threat posed by China or Russia \u2014 or that it has stopped caring deeply about international terrorism.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted for the Chicago Council for Global Affairs last June, international terrorism was listed as a critical threat to the United States by 75 percent of respondents. That was the highest ranking for all choices given. Comparatively, only 38 percent listed China\u2019s military power as a critical threat to the United States, and only 30 percent listed Russia\u2019s territorial ambitions.\n\nA separate poll from Pew Research Center conducted in February and March last year found a similar result \u2014 74 percent of Americans listed the Islamic State as a major threat to the United States, compared with 47 percent who listed Russia\u2019s power and influence and 41 percent who listed China\u2019s power and influence.\n\nThese results may seem surprising. You don\u2019t have to look far to see worrying aspects of Chinese and Russian foreign policy \u2014 the situation in the South China Sea or Ukraine are two obvious examples. Alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election is an additional sign of how Moscow\u2019s foreign policy can hurt the United States, and there is also more subtle evidence that Beijing has undertaken its own effort at covertly influencing U.S. politics.\n\nHowever, the threat from terrorism is simple to understand and specifically designed to instill fear. In contrast, the threats posed by a rising China or Russia are complicated; the United States does not have a purely adversarial role with either.\n\nPew's data show that Americans aren't alone in prioritizing terrorism over Chinese and Russian threats. In 38 countries polled, it found concern about the Islamic State was double that found for Chinese or Russian power. Though some East Asian nations like South Korea and Vietnam were notably concerned about China, concerns about the Islamic State were generally far higher \u2014 a majority listed it as a threat in 29 countries.\n\nIn the United States, concerns about terrorism are largely a bipartisan affair, according to the Chicago Council data. In contrast, majority-level concerns about China\u2019s military power or Russia\u2019s territorial ambitions were limited to Republican leaders (the greater Republican-leaning public did not seem to be especially perturbed by China or Russia).\n\nThe Pentagon is not bound by public opinion, of course. Many have long argued that concerns about terrorism were exaggerated in the West: One widely-shared statistic suggests that Americans are more likely to be killed by a lawn mower than an Islamist militant terrorist.\n\nBut perception can be as important as reality, and Mattis and others in the Trump administration may want to be wary of too quickly dismissing the threat from terrorism. Ahead of the 2016 vote, Pew\u2019s polling found that terrorism was one of the most important issues for voters, second only to the economy. And Trump, the election\u2019s eventual winner and a candidate who talked frequently about terrorism during the campaign, was narrowly favored by voters for his ability to defend the country from future terrorist attacks.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s incoherent message to America\u2019s allies in Asia\n\nAmerica\u2019s forever war is expanding.

You have to think fast and you can\u2019t have any kind of fear factor, which I hope will come in handy on the road.\n\nWhat tools \u2014 literal and online \u2014 are you using to prepare?\n\nAs a great gift to my sanity, Kayak, the online travel aggregator, is working with The Times to handle the first draft of the itinerary, so at least I don\u2019t have to worry about how I\u2019m going to get everywhere or if I\u2019m going to have a place to sleep once I do.\n\nThat leaves me more time to obsess over packing and gearing up. I\u2019ve been scouring the travel recommendations on The Wirecutter, which was my favorite consumer site before The New York Times acquired it, and The Strategist, which I\u2019d also love even of it weren\u2019t affiliated with New York magazine. I\u2019ve found a lot of great blogs with recommendations, like TripSavvy, SmarterTravel, and Travel Fashion Girl, and have pulled ideas from articles by Ashlea Halpern and Paula Froelich, old work friends who both left media jobs like mine to travel the world.\n\nI\u2019ve also had the brains of two foreign correspondent friends to pick: Heidi Vogt of The Wall Street Journal, who\u2019s lived all over Africa and Afghanistan, and Jean Lee, who started The Associated Press\u2019s North Korea bureau. I was just on a snowboarding trip with Jean and downloaded her brain for two hours (look out for that in a future article).\n\nWhat is your greatest hope for the trip?\n\nIs it too cheesy to say I hope to fall in love? It\u2019s been a hard road as a single lady in New York and I\u2019m basically going on the most romantic journey I could imagine. It not likely, given how little time I\u2019ll be spending in most places, but I\u2019m trying to head into this trip as open to whatever comes my way as possible, and I promise to write about it if it happens,\n\nI also think love could come in many unexpected forms: love of a place that I\u2019ll want to return to once this is over; a renewed love for journalism in the expansive forms I\u2019ll be trying; love for one\u2019s self that comes when you\u2019re stretched to your limits and can see your capabilities.\n\nWhat about your greatest fear?\n\nOther than incurring the wrath of Times commenters? Definitely getting sick and being miserable and waylaid for long enough that I mess up the whole project.\n\nDo you think you\u2019ll make it to the final destination?\n\nAnyone who knows me would tell you that I will be there, even if I\u2019m on crutches and harboring a tapeworm.

Ms. Williams, who previously cooked at other restaurants around town, had long wanted to open her own in Detroit, where \u201cas much as we can,\u201d she said, her business is now \u201cgetting the money back into a city that needs to grow the tax base.\u201d\n\nAnd, indeed, her focus is local: Much of Ms. Williams\u2019 produce comes from urban farms, her house gin was created in collaboration with Detroit City Distillery and her tables and bar shelves were made by a local artist. A sense of resourcefulness pervades her cooking, which incorporates so-called ugly foods \u2014 ingredients that would have otherwise been discarded for purely aesthetic reasons \u2014 and whole-animal butchery. \u201cChef is passionate about no waste,\u201d our server informed us. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice at the end of the night that we only have one compost bucket.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t, largely because there was so much else that demanded our attention. Namely, there was the food, which is served on old-fashioned china and could be described as seasonal-voluptuous: roast chicken for four; mighty slabs of mushroom toast smeared with homemade ricotta; crisp-creamy roasted cauliflower served in a puddle of parmesan sauce; a trio of scallops, fat as tuffets, plopped on a bed of polenta cooked in whey; and a sardine tin full of lethally rich shrimp butter, tinted scarlet with a dusting of Aleppo pepper and accompanied by toasted rye-sourdough bread. That bread, not incidentally, is exceptional; it\u2019s the work of Shelby Janisch, the restaurant\u2019s 21-year-old baker who is also, our server said, \u201creally good at puns.\u201d\n\nImage The cozy dining room at Lady of the House. Credit Michelle Gerard\n\nSuch cozy food asks for cozy surroundings, and Ms. Williams has obliged: the dining room has the low lights and polished dark-wood floors of a good pub, along with elegant banquettes upholstered in green velvet and caramel leather and a marble-topped bar. And there is the women\u2019s restroom, where hospitality comes in the form of a machine dispensing free tampons and a bench whose fabric is printed with Ryan Gosling\u2019s face. The bathroom is a subtle nod to female empowerment, said Ms. Williams, adding that the bench, which is bolted to the ground, \u201cis the most photographed thing here.\u201d\n\nAlmost as popular are the restaurant\u2019s potato doughnuts. \u201cMy dad is still passionate about the potato famine,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cSo I was like, I can\u2019t open a restaurant without a white potato dessert.\u201d Served with dried yogurt and a chamomile sauce, they are improbably airy, although we were so stuffed that we had to have them boxed up.

The primary cause of the shutdown: An impasse over President Trump's border and immigration policies, a key campaign promise that became entangled with a measure to renew the government's spending authority. After the vote, both Democrats and Republicans pointed fingers and immediately blamed the other side.It could be several days before the full impact of the shutdown, which comes on the one-year anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration, is fully felt by the public. Here\u2019s a look at what you can expect during the Government Shutdown of 2018.\n\nCLOSE The U.S. government shut down at midnight after Congress failed to resolve a partisan standoff over immigration and spending. In a late-night vote, Senate Democrats blocked a bill that would have kept the government running for four weeks.

The focus in 2018 is on the midterm elections: registering voters, garnering political power and, for some women, running. Rallies will take place throughout the weekend across the country, including in New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Chicago on Saturday. The main Power to the Polls rally will be in Las Vegas on Sunday. What else is different this year?

The show airs at 8 p.m. ET/5 PT Sunday on TNT and TBS. What will they be wearing? Red carpet coverage starts about two hours before, including on USA TODAY's Facebook page. The SAG Awards are often seen as an Oscars predictor because the voters are all actors, and this year's show will have a host for the first time: Kristen Bell. There are plenty of women presenters scheduled, as well as a women's power table, a nod to the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri leads the film categories, and in TV, Big Little Lies, GLOW and Stranger Things dominate. (Here's how to stream the nominees.)

But, despite scoring the lowest approval ratings of any modern president, and facing united Democratic opposition to most of his proposals, Trump has had an important impact on everything from taxesto Americans' regard, or lack of it, for the nation's institutions.

For the Patriots, the focus this week has centered on the hand injury that limited quarterback Tom Brady's practice time. In the late game, the Philadelphia Eagles host the Minnesota Vikings (6:40 p.m. ET, Fox). If the Vikings win, they would be the first team in NFL history to play in the Super Bowl in their home stadium.

(John G. Mabanglo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nIn the wake of its disagreement with the NFL over whether the Oakland Raiders complied with the Rooney Rule while hiring Jon Gruden, the Fritz Pollard Alliance will seek stricter enforcement of the rule and will ask the league to implement other reforms related to employment opportunities for minority coaches, the group said Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe goal for us is strengthening the rule and everything around it \u2014 the whole equal opportunity effort,\u201d said Cyrus Mehri, an attorney for the Fritz Pollard Alliance, the group that has worked closely with the NFL on the league\u2019s minority hiring practices.\n\n[NFL says Raiders complied with Rooney Rule]\n\nMehri said the group will not seek changes to the rule itself. The rule is named for late Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, former chairman of the league\u2019s workplace diversity committee, and it requires each team with a head coaching vacancy to interview at least one minority candidate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to change the rule,\u201d Mehri said in a phone interview.\n\nThe rule also has been extended to cover key front-office positions, such as general manager. In December 2016, the NFL agreed to stretch the rule to informally cover some coordinator positions, albeit without penalties for noncompliance.\n\nMehri said the Fritz Pollard Alliance will press the NFL for more stringent enforcement of the rule. One practical application could be requiring teams to immediately report to the league office any interviews conducted with head coaching candidates not currently employed by NFL teams. Under current procedures, a team immediately reports to the league any interview conducted with an employee of another team. But there is no requirement to report an interview with a candidate, minority or otherwise, from outside the league. Such a change would allow the league to better monitor the hiring process and determine in real time whether there had been compliance with the Rooney Rule, Mehri said.\n\nThe Fritz Pollard Alliance also will push to have the league \u201credouble the effort\u201d to improve the diversity of the NFL\u2019s offensive coordinators, the position from which many head coaches are hired, Mehri said.

The Raiders said they had complied with the rule by interviewing Bobby Johnson, their tight ends coach, and Tee Martin, offensive coordinator at Southern California.\n\nThe Fritz Pollard Alliance expressed strong disagreement, saying the Raiders had an agreement with Gruden in place before any minority candidates were interviewed.

On Friday, Jan. 19, 2018, the former general has announced he will run for a second, four-year term in elections due in March. (Alexander Zemlianichenko, Pool, File/Associated Press)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 Egypt\u2019s president has finally announced he will run for a second, four-year term in elections in March, expertly choosing to break the news and do some not-too-subtle vote-canvassing on live television before an adoring audience of government members, hardcore supporters and powerful media figures.\n\nA general-turned-president with authoritarian practices, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi\u2019s announcement confirmed what was long expected and paved the way for his virtually certain triumph in the March 26-28 vote.\n\nThe closing session of a three-day conference called to assess his performance in office offered el-Sissi a perfectly-timed opportunity to list what\u2019s been touted as his achievements. He used the platform to reach out to voters with a mixture of affected humility and fear-mongering appeals to national interests.\n\nHis announcement came hours before another graduate of Egypt\u2019s powerful military institution, former chief of staff Sami Annan, said he too would run, and immediately sniped at the incumbent.\n\n\u201cI call on the state\u2019s civilian and military institutions to be neutral and not unconstitutionally biased in favor of a president who may leave his post within months,\u201d he said in a video statement posted on his Facebook account.\n\nA comfortable win for el-Sissi is all but certain given that no serious threat to his re-election is likely to come from any of the presidential hopefuls announced so far, Annan included. Moreover, el-Sissi has the vast resources of the state, including its media, at his disposal to promote himself and speak directly to voters. His rivals have had virtually no access to the media and are ruthlessly vilified or mocked by el-Sissi loyalists who dominate TV talk shows and newspapers.\n\n\u201cI find myself standing once again before my national conscience ... asking you to accept my candidacy for the position of president of the republic so I can win your trust for a second presidential term,\u201d el-Sissi said late Friday to a standing ovation, cheers, women\u2019s ululations and \u201clong live Egypt!\u201d \u2014 the president\u2019s favorite chant.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give your vote except to someone you trust to take care of your affairs,\u201d he said, \u201cYou must choose very carefully because you will hand over to him (the winner) your future and the future of your children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nHe added that he would never allow anyone \u201ccorrupt\u201d to take his place.\n\n\u201cCan I be aware that someone is a thief and silently allow him to sit on this chair?\u201d a charged el-Sissi put to the crowd, \u201cGod will hold me accountable and ask me why I remained silent. Egypt is bigger, dearer, more honorable and dignified than to be ruled by bad people.\u201d\n\nHis comment drew criticism by prominent rights lawyer Nasser Amin who warned in a Facebook post that it broke the law and breached the constitution. \u201cThe implications of this comment are dangerous and worrying and means that the election will be run according to the views of one candidate,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEl-Sissi has often said he wants to establish a modern civil state in Egypt, but his policies have raised questions over whether he actually believes in universal democratic principles and freedoms. His public discourse has almost exclusively been focused on his efforts to revive an ailing economy and the infrastructure \u201cmega projects\u201d he has overseen.\n\nAs defense minister, el-Sissi led the military\u2019s 2013 ouster of Egypt\u2019s first freely elected leader, the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, whose one-year rule proved divisive. He has since overseen a harsh crackdown on the opposition, jailing thousands of Islamists along with hundreds of secular activists, including prominent figures from the 2011 uprising that toppled the regime of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak.\n\nStreet protests have been effectively banned, human rights groups have been placed under severe restrictions and many critics in the media have been silenced, measures el-Sissi describes as necessary to restore stability, rebuild the economy after years of unrest and fight an Islamic State-led insurgency.\n\nFielding questions submitted online at the invitation of his office, el-Sissi on Friday night dodged one on human rights, and another on the exclusion of political parties, but instead repeated his signature argument that his view of human rights prioritizes the right to jobs, decent housing and reliable education and health services.\n\n\u201cThere are many other rights whose violation is crueler than violating political rights,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the president appeared more accommodating when he spoke of rights for women, whose support has been crucial for el-Sissi.\n\nOn Friday, he strongly admonished men who harass women, a widespread practice in Egypt that affects both homemakers and working women. He scolded harassers: \u201cShame on you!\u201d He also praised women\u2019s role in families and, as he has frequently done before, spoke compassionately about his late mother, boasting that he helped her with house chores while growing up in Cairo\u2019s medieval quarter of al-Hussein.\n\n\u201cWhen we had people over for a meal, I prepared the table with her,\u201d he said to a round of applause.\n\n\u201cManliness is something totally different from what people know here in Egypt,\u201d he said, alluding to the chauvinistic nature of Egyptian society and the common reluctance by men to help out at home.\n\nEl-Sissi appointed two more women to the Cabinet earlier this month, raising to an all-time high of six the number of women in his government.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Menna Zaki contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Turkish jets have begun an aerial offensive, codenamed operation \u201cOlive Branch\u201d, against the Syrian Kurdish-held enclave of Afrin, in northwest Syria . A military statement says the operation launched Saturday aims to protect Turkey\u2019s borders, \u201cneutralize\u201d Syrian Kurdish fighters in the enclave and to save the local population from their \u201cpressure and oppression.\u201d (Lefteris Pitarakis/Associated Press)\n\nKOCABEYLI, Turkey \u2014 Turkish jets bombed the Kurdish-controlled city of Afrin in northern Syria on Saturday, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to expand Turkey\u2019s military border operations against a Kurdish group that has been the U.S.\u2019s key Syria ally in the war on the Islamic State group.\n\nThe raids came on the heels of a week of sharp threats by the Turkish government, promising to clear the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, from Afrin and its surrounding countryside, also called Afrin. Turkey\u2019s military is calling the campaign Operation Olive Branch.\n\nTurkey says the YPG \u2014 a group it considers a terrorist organization \u2014 is an extension of an outlawed Kurdish rebel group that it is fighting inside its own borders, and it has found common cause with Syrian opposition groups who view the YPG as a counter-revolutionary force in Syria\u2019s multi-sided civil war.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said a ground offensive could begin Sunday, but the state run Anadolu News Agency reported that Syrian forces backed by Ankara had already penetrated the Kurdish enclave. They crossed over from Turkey but were turned back by the YPG, according to Rojhat Roj, a Kurdish spokesman.\n\nAssociated Press journalists at the Turkish border saw jets bombing positions in the direction of Afrin, as a convoy of armed pickup trucks and buses believed to be carrying Syrian opposition fighters traveled along the border. Video from Turkey this week showed the military moving tanks to the frontier.\n\nRoads out of the Afrin were closed and the YPG were not allowing anyone to leave the city, but morale was high, according to a resident who was reached by phone.\n\n\u201cSo far the People\u2019s Protection Units have not called on the people to mobilize,\u201d said Ramzi Hamidi. Turkey, he said, \u201cwill learn a lesson they have not learned before.\u201d\n\nTen civilians were wounded in the airstrikes, three seriously, according to Roj.\n\nTurkey has prepared around 10,000 Syrian fighters to storm Afrin, according Rami Abudrrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group. A rebel commander speaking to the AP by phone from north Syria said there were thousands of fighters positioned in Azaz, at the frontier with the Kurdish enclave, awaiting orders. Another commander said hundreds more were stationed in Atmeh, south of Afrin. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said, meanwhile, that it was pulling back troops that had been deployed near Afrin, two days after Turkey\u2019s military and intelligence briefs travelled to Moscow to discuss the planned operation. It said the group of observers was being relocated to another area. It was not immediately clear how many troops were affected by the move.\n\nThe YPG is the driving force behind a coalition of north Syrian forces allied with the U.S. to battle the Islamic State group. With U.S. support, including around 2,000 embedded forces, the coalition now controls close to a quarter of Syrian territory, concentrated mostly to the north and east of the Euphrates River.\n\nTurkish leaders were infuriated by an announcement by the U.S. military six days ago that it was going to create a 30,000-strong border force with the Kurdish fighters to secure northern Syria. Days later, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that the U.S. would maintain a military presence with the Kurds for the foreseeable future.\n\nTillerson spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the U.S. State Department said. No details about the calls were immediately available, but the State Department has previously said it\u2019s urging against escalation.\n\nSpeaking in the city of Kutahya in western Turkey, Erdogan announced an expansion to Turkish operations in Syria, promising to move on the Kurdish-controlled town of Manbij and its surrounding countryside after completing operations in Afrin. The operation would force out the Kurdish militia from all positions west of the Euphrates River.\n\nIn 2016, Turkey trained and equipped opposition forces to drive Kurdish fighters out of parts of north Syria, driving a wedge between two enclaves along the Turkish frontier. Turkish ground forces, including tanks and artillery, crossed into Syria with the fighters to establish a zone flanked by Afrin and Manbij that now serves as hub for Turkish operations inside the war-torn country.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the strikes on Afrin marked the start of a campaign to \u201celiminate the PYD and PKK and Daesh elements in Afrin,\u201d referring to the Kurdish Democratic Union Party and the Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party respectively, and using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.\n\nThe PYD, PKK, and YPG all look to the Kurdish Marxist-nationalist leader Abdullah Ocalan as their guide. Ocalan is imprisoned by Turkey for waging a separatist movement in the eastern part of the country. The IS group does not have a presence in Afrin.\n\nThe air strikes were accompanied by waves of artillery strikes on the Afrin region. Syria\u2019s Foreign Ministry promptly condemned the Turkish operation.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu discussed the operation with Tillerson by phone on Sunday after the U.S. diplomat requested a conversation, Turkish officials said. They did not provide further details.\n\nAny ground operation would entail considerable military and political risk for Ankara. Russia was keeping military observers in Afrin and lately firmed up its ties with the YPG, while Syria\u2019s government in Damascus said it would shoot down any Turkish jets on raids in the country. The YPG is estimated to have between 8,000 and 10,000 fighters in Afrin. Turkey could also face blowback from the Kurdish insurgency within its own borders.\n\nA ground offensive or continued shelling would exacerbate the poor humanitarian situation in Afrin, which is now home to at least 800,000 civilians, including many who arrived fleeing the fighting in other parts of Syria.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Syrian government forces and supporting militias retook a key air base in northwest Syria lost to rebels in 2015.\n\nSyria\u2019s state broadcaster said Syrian troops fought their way into the strategic Abu Zuhour air base in Idlib province.\n\nIt was a coup for the government and allied militias who advanced swiftly to take the base in what was considered a stronghold for rebels and al-Qaida insurgents.\n\nBut the advance, which began in earnest in late December, has displaced more than 200,000 civilians, according to the U.N., exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the north of the country.\n\n___\n\nIssa reported from Beirut.

(Susan Walsh, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence is making his fourth visit to Israel, returning to a region he\u2019s visited \u201ca million times\u201d in his heart.\n\nAn evangelical Christian with strong ties to the Holy Land, Pence this time comes packing two key policy decisions in his bags that have long been top priorities for him: designating Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and curtailing aid for Palestinians.\n\nPence departed as scheduled Friday evening as U.S. lawmakers sought to avert a federal government shutdown at midnight. Alyssa Farah, a Pence spokeswoman, said the trip was \u201cintegral to America\u2019s national security and diplomatic objectives\u201d and would go on as scheduled. Pence was set to depart Friday evening, and Air Force Two was expected to land in Ireland for a refueling stop early Saturday en route to Cairo.\n\nDuring a stopover in Ireland, Pence greeted US soldiers at Shannon Airport in Ireland hours after the federal government shutdown. Pence told troops: \u201cWe\u2019ll get this thing figured out in Washington.\u201d\n\nHe told the soldiers to \u201cstay focused on your mission.\u201d\n\nPence told reporters that \u201cwe have soldiers that are headed down range to Kuwait for six months in a critical theater to serve the country, and yet because of Democrats in the Senate, they have anxiety about their pay.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to every American that Democrats would shut down the government at a time when we have troops in harms way.\u201d\n\nSince his days in Congress a decade ago, Pence has played a role in pushing both for the shift in U.S. policy related to the capital and for placing limits on funding for Palestinian causes long criticized by Israel.\n\nTraveling to Israel just as Palestinians have condemned recent decisions by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Pence will arrive in the region as a longtime stalwart supporter of Israel who has questioned the notion of the U.S. serving as an \u201chonest broker\u201d in the stalled peace process.\n\n\u201cThe United States certainly wants to be honest, but we don\u2019t want to be a broker,\u201d Pence once told the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2010. \u201cA broker doesn\u2019t take sides. A broker negotiates between parties of equals.\u201d\n\nThe vice president will hold four days of meetings in Egypt, Jordan and Israel during his visit, the first to the region by a senior administration official since Trump announced plans in December to designate Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv, angering Palestinian leaders.\n\nHis trip will also follow Tuesday\u2019s announcement that the U.S. is withholding $65 million of a planned $125 million funding installment to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which provides health care, education and social services to Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nBoth decisions have come as Trump has expressed frustration over a lack of progress in restarting peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, who withdrew plans to meet with Pence during his visit to the Middle East.\n\nSenior White House officials said security issues, countering terrorism and efforts to push back against Iran would figure prominently during Pence\u2019s trip, which concludes on Tuesday. But the vice president also is expected to face questions about Israel\u2019s future.\n\nOn the embassy, Pence played a steady role in pushing for the shift in U.S. policy. The decision upended past U.S. views that Jerusalem\u2019s status should be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.\n\nPence had wanted the Trump administration to convey \u201ca clear-cut policy\u201d on Jerusalem after the president asked him last summer to visit the Middle East, White House officials have said.\n\nPence discussed the issue with Jewish and evangelical leaders in the months leading up to the decision and advocated for the plan within the administration. But he noted to religious leaders late last year that the decision was the president\u2019s alone and would fulfill a commitment from the 2016 campaign.\n\nPence has long aligned himself with Israel.\n\nIn Congress, he pushed for limiting U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority during the presidency of George W. Bush, warning the funding could be redirected to groups like the militant Hamas movement, which controls Gaza.\n\nHe was a vocal advocate for Israel\u2019s security fence and co-sponsored the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act in 2011 to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s undivided capital. Veteran House members recall Pence\u2019s role as a staunch ally of Israeli causes and his steadfast support for moving the embassy to Jerusalem at times when few were talking about the issue.\n\nAs Indiana\u2019s governor, Pence signed a bill requiring the state to divest from any business that engaged in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement \u2014 a grassroots international boycott movement against Israel.\n\nKenneth Weinstein, CEO of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, said it has been \u201ccentral to his political life from the absolute outset, from when he first ran for Congress \u2014 it\u2019s something that\u2019s central to who he is, to what he believes in.\u201d\n\nPence traveled to Israel for the first time as an Indiana congressman in January 2004, joining a delegation from the Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis. He placed a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and visited the Western Wall, both of which are on Pence\u2019s itinerary again next week, and he had a private meeting with then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.\n\nDoug Rose, a philanthropist in Indianapolis, flew with Pence on his 2004 trip to Israel and recalled him being deeply affected by the experience. \u201cHow could you not be moved?\u201d Rose said of their site visits.\n\nPence told the Indiana Jewish Post and Opinion after his 2004 trip that he was often asked if he had been to Israel before, \u201cand my response was, \u2018Only in my dreams.\u2019 I was raised an evangelical Christian and tried to read the Bible every day, so in my mind and in my heart I have been there a million times.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision on Jerusalem has drawn protests from Middle Eastern leaders and prompted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to pull out of a planned meeting with Pence in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem. Administration officials said Pence is not expected to meet with Palestinian leaders during the trip.\n\nPence remains popular with evangelical voters in the U.S., a large and influential constituency that helped propel Trump to victory in last year\u2019s election. American evangelicals, especially the older generation, have a strong affinity for Israel, drawn both on spiritual grounds and a genuine love for the modern-day country and the Jewish people.\n\n\u201cFrom our very first meeting, I knew this was a man deeply committed to standing with Israel,\u201d said the Rev. John Hagee, founder and chairman of Christians United for Israel, whose organization helped pay for a portion of Pence\u2019s trip to Israel with family members in 2014.\n\nRabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the U.S.-born founder and president of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, a charity that raises tens of millions of dollars for Israeli causes from American evangelicals, said Pence\u2019s upcoming visit should go over well with evangelicals and help shore up their support for the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an extension of evangelicalism and evangelical feelings for Israel, and its history,\u201d Eckstein said. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have that history. Pence has that history of being pro-Israel.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\n__\n\nThis story has been corrected to say this is Pence\u2019s fourth trip to Israel.

He now averages 5.9 per day. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nOne year after taking the oath of office, President Trump has made 2,140 false or misleading claims, according to The Fact Checker\u2019s database that analyzes, categorizes and tracks every suspect statement uttered by the president. That\u2019s an average of nearly 5.9 claims a day.\n\nWe started this project as part of our coverage of the president\u2019s first 100 days, largely because we could not possibly keep up with the pace and volume of the president\u2019s misstatements. Readers demanded we keep it going for another year. The database has proved so useful \u2014 and even sparked the interest of academicians \u2014 that we now plan to keep it going for the rest of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nOur interactive graphic, created with the help of Leslie Shapiro and Kaeti Hinck of The Post graphics department, displays a running list of every false or misleading statement made by Trump. We also catalogued the president\u2019s many flip-flops, since those earn Upside-Down Pinocchios if a politician shifts position on an issue without acknowledging he or she did so.\n\nWhile the president is known to make outrageous claims on Twitter \u2014 and that was certainly a major source of his falsehoods \u2014 he made most of his false statements in unscripted remarks before reporters. Prepared speeches and interviews were other key sources of false claims. That\u2019s because the president relies on talking points or assertions that he had made in the past \u2014 and continued to make, even though they had been fact-checked as wrong.\n\nThis makes Trump somewhat unique among politicians. Many will drop a false claim after it has been deemed false. But Trump just repeats the same claim over and over, perhaps believing that repetition will make it ring truer.\n\nBy our count, there were only 56 days \u2014 or about 15 percent of the time \u2014 on which we recorded no claims. These were often days when the president golfed.\n\nBut there were also 12 days in which Trump made more than 30 claims. These were often days when he held campaign-style rallies, riffing without much of a script. On July 25, when he held a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, we recorded 52 claims. On Nov. 29, when he spoke in St. Louis, we counted 49 claims. On Dec. 8, he touted Senate hopeful Roy Moore at a rally in Pensacola, Fla., and that yielded another 44 claims.\n\nThere\u2019s a pattern about Trump\u2019s exaggerations. Often he inflates the impact of his own actions \u2014 or he denigrates people or programs he dislikes. This dynamic is represented in the near-tie for Trump\u2019s most repeated claims. Both of these claims date from the start of Trump\u2019s presidency and to a large extent have faded as talking points.\n\nFrom his earliest days as president, Trump repeatedly took credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office \u2014 or had even been elected. Sixty-two times, he has touted that he secured business investments and job announcements that had been previously announced and could easily be found with a Google search.\n\nAmong other deals, Trump took credit for a $1 billion investment by Fiat Chrysler (which the company said was due to talks with unions in 2015), a $1 billion General Motors investment (also in the works for some time), 10,000 jobs added by Walmart (announced in 2016), 10,000 jobs created by Intel (announced originally in 2011), 1 million planned jobs by Chinese e-company Alibaba (a plan outlined in 2015) and a $25 billion investment by Charter Communications (in the works since 2015). Trump also touted a big investment by Japanese company SoftBank \u2014 which announced its investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory.\n\nObviously, now that he\u2019s been president for a year, there should be less of a need for Trump to point to deals that predated his presidency.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly asserted (61 times) that the Affordable Care Act was failing or on the edge of disaster or in serious trouble. But the Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, is not imploding and is expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Indeed, robust enrollment for 2018 has surprised health-care experts.\n\nWith the successful push in Congress to pass a tax plan, two of Trump\u2019s favorite talking points about taxes \u2014 that the tax plan will be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history and that the United States is one of the highest-taxed nations \u2014 were near the top of the list.\n\nTrump 57 times repeated the falsehood about having the biggest tax cut in U.S. history, even though Treasury Department data shows it would rank eighth. And 59 times Trump has claimed that the United States pays the highest corporate taxes (26 times) or that it is one of the highest-taxed nations (33 times). The latter is false; the former is misleading, as the effective U.S. corporate tax rate (what companies end up paying after deductions and benefits) ends up being lower than the statutory tax rate.\n\nTrump also made many misleading claims about the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, claiming 44 times a variation of the statement that it was a hoax perpetuated by Democrats. The CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency had announced that they had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to influence the election, with a clear preference for Trump. Robert S. Mueller III, the special prosecutor, was appointed by Trump\u2019s Justice Department, and the congressional committees investigating the matter are headed by Republicans.\n\nConsidering that he has been president for a year, we continue to be surprised to see that the president still does not speak correctly about trade deficits and trade policy. On 35 occasions, Trump managed to inflate the U.S. trade deficits with Mexico, South Korea and Canada, or falsely claim the United States had no trade surpluses with any nation \u2014 even though the United States has one with its neighbor to the north.\n\nWe also track the president\u2019s flip-flops on our list, as they are so glaring. He spent the 2016 campaign telling supporters that the unemployment rate was really 42 percent and the official statistics were phony; now, on 50 occasions he has hailed the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years. It was already very low when he was elected \u2014 4.6 percent, the lowest in a decade \u2014 so his failure to acknowledge that is misleading. Eleven other times, Trump claimed credit for good African American unemployment numbers, which had plummeted during President Barack Obama\u2019s term.\n\nAn astonishing 95 times, Trump has celebrated a rise in the stock market \u2014 even though in the campaign he repeatedly said it was a \u201cbubble\u201d that was ready to crash as soon as the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Well, the Fed has raised rates four times since the election \u2014 and yet the stock market has not plunged as Trump predicted. It has continued a rise in stock prices that began under Obama in 2009. Again, Trump has never explained his shift in position on the stock market, making his consistent cheerleading misleading.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. stock market rise in 2017 was not unique and mirrored a global rise in equities. When looking at the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which is less influenced by individual stocks than the Dow Jones industrial average, it\u2019s clear U.S. stocks haven\u2019t rallied as robustly as some foreign equivalents. The percentage gain in the S&P 500 during Obama\u2019s first year tops Trump\u2019s numbers \u2014 though any president bragging about stock market performance soon finds out it\u2019s a fool\u2019s game. (The percentage gain under Trump ranks fifth in the first years of presidential terms.)\n\nTwice in the past year, the president has publicly said he doesn\u2019t like getting Pinocchios. Given the president\u2019s track record in his first year, there is certainly room for improvement.\n\n(Contributors to the database over the past year included Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Nicole Lewis)\n\nTrump Promise Tracker: We\u2019ve also been tracking the status of 60 key promises made by Trump.

(Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nAfter a plodding loss to the Montreal Canadiens on Friday night, Capitals Coach Barry Trotz made some big line changes at Saturday\u2019s practice. Here is how the Capitals looked while skating at Kettler Iceplex, which was brimming with fans as the team took the ice before a bit before 11:30 a.m.:\n\nAlex Ovechkin-Evgeny Kuznetsov-Tom Wilson\n\nAndre Burakovsky-Nicklas Backstrom-T.J. Oshie\n\nChandler Stephenson-Lars Eller-Brett Connolly\n\nDevante Smith-Pelly-Jay Beagle-Alex Chiasson\n\nThat left 21-year-old Jakub Vrana cycling in and out, and it looks like he will be a healthy scratch when the Capitals face the Philadelphia Flyers at 12:30 p.m. Sunday at Capital One Arena. Saturday\u2019s practice was the last time the team skated before that game, which will be a chance for the Capitals to bounce back after back-to-back losses Thursday (4-3 at the New Jersey Devils in overtime) and Friday (3-2 to the Canadiens). The biggest change is Trotz splitting up Ovechkin and Backstrom, something he did to start the season before reuniting them against Ottawa on Nov. 22.\n\nThe Capitals beat the Senators, 5-2, that day and then won 10 of their subsequent 12 games. In the 25 games Ovechkin and Backstrom have skated together since, the team is 17-5-3, and Ovechkin is tied for the league lead with 28 goals this season. But Trotz felt the need to shake things up after two straight lethargic outings, and that could mean spreading out his two best offensive players.\n\n\u201cJust like anything, if you\u2019ve watched us play lately, we\u2019ve gone a little bit stale. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the break, but I go right before the break,\u201d Trotz said, nodding to the Capitals\u2019 five-day bye week that ended Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve been contemplating, maybe it\u2019s time for a little switch. It might be a game. It might be the next 20 \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Eighty-two games, teams have lulls in the way they play and how they play and how they execute and, production-wise, we got guys that are really, last 10, 12 games, we\u2019ve gotten zero. Fundamentally have gotten nothing.\u201d\n\n[Jay Beagle wants to win every faceoff. The goal is simple but the nuances aren\u2019t.]\n\nIn last spring\u2019s second-round playoff series against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Trotz shifted Ovechkin away from Backstrom and united Burakovsky, Backstrom and Oshie. That line was also together for a bit at the start of this season, but Oshie acknowledged Saturday that none of the three players was playing well at that time. Backstrom, one of the NHL\u2019s most skilled passers, has a chance to elevate Oshie and Burakovsky out of offensive slumps.\n\nOshie has scored just once in his past 20 games and has only four even-strength goals all season. Last year, he finished with a career-high 25 even-strength goals. Burakovsky, who was the team\u2019s best skater in Friday\u2019s loss after sitting for the previous three games due to illness and a healthy scratch, has not tallied a point in his past seven appearances.\n\n\u201cI think just Oshie\u2019s skill and work ethic, and Nick\u2019s skill and feel for the game, it\u2019s just a perfect combination,\u201d Burakovsky said Saturday. \u201cI think when you get with Nick and Oshie, they can create something from nothing every time, and they are such smart players. The only thing I have to do is skate and be open.\u201d\n\nThey aren\u2019t the only players who could use a lift. Kuznetsov has scored once in his past 11 games and can only benefit from the attention Ovechkin draws from the opposition. The third line of Connolly, Eller and Oshie was playing well together the past few weeks, but Trotz opted to stack the first and second lines with players who have typically been the Capitals\u2019 \u201ctop-six forwards\u201d across this season and last.\n\n\u201cAs a coach, as I have in the last couple games, I move lines around,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cSometimes it works. It worked for us in Carolina. I think it worked for us a bit in New Jersey in the third. [Against the Canadiens,] it didn\u2019t have much of an effect.\u201d\n\nNow it seems that Trotz will try something else against the Flyers, his most drastic changes of this recent stretch.\n\nMore Capitals coverage:\n\nCapitals make some changes, but Canadiens leave them at a loss\n\nCapitals make their point but fall to Devils in overtime\n\nCapitals need to tighten up the power play\n\nCapitals rookie Madison Bowey honors NHL pioneer Willie O\u2019Ree by wearing No. 22", "title": "Capitals shuffle lines, splitting up Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom, before Flyers game", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capitals-insider/wp/2018/01/20/capitals-shuffle-lines-splitting-up-alex-ovechkin-and-nicklas-backstrom-before-flyers-game/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T07:40:00Z"}, {"textData": "An unidentified woman tries to comfort the grieving relative of an Indian man Garu Singh, 55, who was killed in Pakistani firing and shelling, as she wails in Ranbir Singh Pura district of Jammu and Kashmir, India, Saturday, Jan. 20, 2018.

During a press conference Saturday, police announced the arrest of Boonchai who allegedly fueled much of Asia\u2019s illegal wildlife trade for over the last decade. (Tassanee Vejpongsa/Associated Press)\n\nBANGKOK \u2014 Thai police have arrested a suspected kingpin of wildlife trafficking who allegedly fueled much of Asia\u2019s illegal trade for over a decade, officials said Saturday.\n\nBoonchai Bach, a 40-year-old Thai of Vietnamese descent, was arrested Friday in the northeastern border province of Nakhon Phanom in connection with the with smuggling of 14 rhino horns worth over $1 million from Africa into Thailand last month, in a case that also implicated a Thai official and a Chinese and a Vietnamese courier, Thai police said.\n\nBoonchai allegedly ran a large trafficking network on the Thai-Laos border that spread into Vietnam. According to the anti-trafficking group Freeland Foundation, he and his family played a key role in a criminal syndicate that has smuggled poached items including ivory, rhino horn, pangolins, tigers, lions and other rare and endangered species.\n\nPolice said Boonchai denied the charges against him. Under the wildlife law, he could face up to four years in prison and a 40,000 baht ($1,300) fine, but authorities said they\u2019re also considering money-laundering and customs violation charges that carry up to 10 years in prison.\n\n\u201cOne of the largest known wildlife traffickers in a really big syndicate has been arrested,\u201d said Matthew Pritchett, Freeland\u2019s director of communications. \u201cIn a nutshell, I can\u2019t think of anything in the past five years that has been this significant.\u201d\n\nThailand is a transit hub for trafficked wildlife mostly destined for China, and was considered to have the largest unregulated ivory market in the world before it introduced the Elephant Ivory Act of 2014 and 2015 to regulate the domestic ivory market and criminalize the sale of African elephant ivory. Rhinoceros horns, pangolin scales, turtles, and other exotic wildlife are still repeatedly smuggled through Thailand.\n\nIn December, Thai airport official Nikorn Wongprajan was arrested at Suvarnabhumi Airport after he was caught together with a Chinese smuggler and a Vietnamese courier with 14 rhino horns and admitted to being hired to send the horns to one of Boonchai\u2019s relatives, Freeland\u2019s statement said, adding the group helped Thai police with information about Boonchai that led to his arrest.\n\nSteve Galster, founder of Freeland, said Boonchai\u2019s arrest breaks open Thailand\u2019s \u201clargest wildlife crime case ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis network is connected to a group of moneymen who may be living outside the country. We are working to get arrest warrants out on those people as well,\u201d said Gen. Chalermkiat Sriworakhan, deputy police commissioner. Three years ago, Thailand froze $37 million in assets linked to a tiger trafficking ring in the country\u2019s northeast, after investigation helped by Freeland. In 2016, a court order seized Thai bank accounts and other assets, including a house worth $142,000, belonging to Chumlong Lemtongthai, a Thai who was convicted in South Africa on rhino horn trafficking charges.\n\nChumlung was imprisoned in 2012 after being sent by the Southeast Asian trafficking syndicate called the Xaysavang network \u2014 which authorities say includes Boonchai \u2014 to take advantage of South Africa\u2019s permit system for professional trophy hunts. He hired prostitutes to pose as hunters, and organized sham expeditions during which 26 rhinos were killed, according to court documents. Customs papers were then doctored for shipping the rhino horns to Laos.\n\nThe decision to go after Chumlung\u2019s assets was made only in 2016, after agents received training in asset recovery. The alleged Laotian kingpin of the Xaysavang network, Vixay Keosavang, remains at large with a U.S. bounty of $1 million on his head.\n\n\u201cWe have been looking at this syndicate for over a decade now,\u201d said Onkuri Majumdar, a program officer from Freeland. \u201cThey have tentacles all over Africa and Southeast Asia. They are responsible for the slaughter of thousands of endangered animals including rhinos and elephants. And let\u2019s not forget rangers in Africa who have died, killed by poachers financed by men like Boonchai.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kaweewit Kaewjinda contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

When I booked that cottage online, I sifted through the reviews, trying to glean whether the location was as pristine as the pictures suggested. I didn\u2019t spend much time wondering how those depictions made the host feel \u2014 I just wanted to make sure the place wasn\u2019t a dump. I understand that hosts want reassurances, too. No one wants to rent to a person who used the last rental as a temporary brothel or drug den.\n\nBut if you think you belong on the good side of the bell curve, it hurts to hear someone tell you that perhaps you do not. When such a critique comes at the end of a long and intimate experience like a stay in an Airbnb house, you can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s true. Maybe I am an incompetent housekeeper.\n\nStay in someone\u2019s home long enough and you feel like you know the person, even if you have never meet. For two weeks, I admired my host\u2019s book collection (she liked Mary Oliver, my husband\u2019s favorite poet) and looked at her artwork. I glanced at the muck boots in the garage, and imagined a quiet woman pruning those gorgeous hydrangeas in the garden. I spotted a box of art supplies in the closet, and wondered how long she had spent painting that seascape in the bedroom.\n\nIn text messages, I told her that we enjoyed the house and let her know when I noticed ants by the front door. Her replies were curt, but she gave me directions for how to address the issue, so I didn\u2019t hold it against her. I assumed she saw me as I saw myself: a considerate and attentive houseguest.\n\nInstead, she saw me as a naughty one.\n\n\u201cOf course you take it personally,\u201d said Paul Levinson, a professor of communications and media studies at Fordham University and the author of \u201cNew New Media.\u201d\n\nAs I sat at my computer, absorbing the criticism, my mind drifted to the review I had left of the house. Since the process is double-blind, guests and hosts can only see each other\u2019s reviews after both have written them. You cannot revise what you wrote in light of new information from the other side, and no wonder. Like in the aftermath of a heated argument, I replayed the words I had written, imagining what I would have said if I had let loose \u2014 I\u2019m talking about that ant trail and the scant cleaning supplies (hello! a bottle of Lysol certainly would have helped get the job done).\n\nSince I couldn\u2019t rewrite my own assessment, I instead fired off a response to hers, in defense of my efforts. I hit send and my response appeared publicly below the one she had left of me. It didn\u2019t take long for the doubt to creep in: Maybe, by responding, I looked not only messy, but crazy, too. Mr. Levinson seemed to agree: \u201cThe best response is no response,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wind up looking defensive no matter what you say.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAirbnb, however, sees such an exchange in a different light. \u201cThat\u2019s how the system should work,\u201d said Nick Shapiro, the global head of trust and risk management at Airbnb. \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s one alternative: Not having my cleaning skills publicly parsed. Other Airbnb guests have also felt burned by a harsh critique. Alrica Goldstein, 42, a book editor in Reno, Nev., was shocked by a bad review she received after staying in an apartment in Kuala Lumpur with her family in August 2016. \u201cI was terribly offended,\u201d she said.\n\nThe apartment was left in a sorry state, with a dirty stove and toilet, according to the host. But Ms. Goldstein had not seen the criticism coming. The host had stopped by on checkout day and stayed to chat for a while, never voicing any concerns. \u201cI feel like when you stay in an Airbnb, it\u2019s a community. There\u2019s a give and take and trust,\u201d she said. In this case, Ms. Goldstein felt the circle of trust had been broken.\n\nHow much does a bad review harm you? It\u2019s hard to say. But I suspect that naysayers have a way of sounding like soothsayers. \u201cI see just one negative review, and it makes me wonder,\u201d said Turner Wright, the digital media manager for AirbnbHell.com, a website that chronicles Airbnb miseries. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the real one.\u201d\n\nMaybe Mr. Wright was right. Maybe I would be shunned. When it came time to book another stay a few months later, this time in Northampton, Mass., I admit, my heart was racing. \u201cWhat if they reject us?\u201d my son asked. To improve our chances, I wrote a witty note, one that would paint a picture of a responsible and charming little family. Maybe the owner would fall for it. The host \u2014 a superhost, in Airbnb speak, or someone considered experienced and a role model for other hosts \u2014 accepted my request within minutes. I had dodged a blacklist!\n\nThese reviews are meant to make us better versions of ourselves \u2014 next time that stove will sparkle \u2014 but maybe they just make us more neurotic.\n\nWhen we arrived in Northampton after a long drive, tired and disheveled, our host let us into the apartment. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about cleaning up when you leave,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\n\nI wanted to believe that she said this to be helpful, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she really said it because she knew I was a slob.", "title": null, "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/realestate/surviving-a-bad-airbnb-review.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T06:42:30Z"}, {"textData": "\n\nKelly Oubre Jr., left, scored 26 points and hit 5 of 9 three-pointers against the Pistons on Friday night. (Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\n\nDETROIT \u2014 On his career night, Kelly Oubre Jr. provided his most signature celebration.\n\nAfter most of Oubre\u2019s five three-point baskets, he extended his index finger to his lips or blew a kiss into the stands at Little Caesars Arena. But when Oubre silenced a Pistons rally by making his final three-pointer while getting knocked to the floor late in the game, he placed his hands on his hips, tilted his head and flashed a cheesy smile in the direction of Pistons assistant coach Tim Hardaway.\n\nWith the pose, Oubre seemed to be expressing peak confidence. And after leading the Wizards on the scoreboard while tallying a career-best 26 points in a 122-112 win, Oubre\u2019s poise was praised by his team.\n\n[Wizards deliver a solid effort and get a win to show for it]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d John Wall said. \u201cKelly put a lot of work into this game. He\u2019s a knockdown shooter for us.\u201d\n\nOubre made more deep looks than Bradley Beal (4 of 7) and Otto Porter Jr. (4 of 5) as the Wizards connected on 16 of 35 attempts from beyond the arc. Benefiting from the team\u2019s willingness to make the extra pass against the Pistons, Oubre continued a wave of hot shooting from downtown.\n\nBefore the start of the season, Oubre revealed that he had changed his shooting mechanics. The left-handed shooter moved his elbow so that his form no longer obstructs his vision. The tweak has helped Oubre maintain a consistent three-point percentage in the high 30s throughout his third NBA season. And over the past five games, he has shot 53.3 percent to raise his season-long mark to 40.5 percent.\n\n\u201cI was just following my fundamentals,\u201d said Oubre, who credited his trainer, Drew Hanlen, \u201cmy basic principles that me and Drew work on. They were working tonight. I stayed disciplined. I tried to stay locked in throughout the whole game. You know, I see where it leads me, so staying locked in is definitely the key to success.\u201d\n\nTeammates have noticed. During consecutive games of Washington\u2019s recent homestand, Oubre was given the last shots to end a quarter and nailed the buzzer beaters. Oubre also provided a rare highlight in the Wizards\u2019 133-109 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday by hitting 3 of 5 attempts from the arc.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing for us all year,\u201d Wall said, \u201cbeing able to knock down shots and shooting with a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nBy Friday night, Coach Scott Brooks rewarded Oubre with starters\u2019 minutes and applauded his competitiveness through all 31 of those minutes.\n\n\u201cHe competes,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI always challenge him because at times he makes mistakes, but I\u2019m not just going to let him make mistakes and chalk it up to he\u2019s young. I keep challenging him. I keep trying to get him better, and you get better day by day, by working, by showing effort, by watching film, by competing. You don\u2019t get better by not doing that. So he does that every night. Steps up and spaces the floor. His shot has been worked on. Give him credit. He\u2019s developed that.\u201d\n\nAnd as for Oubre\u2019s meme-worthy celebration after hitting the big shot? He grinned wide once a reporter brought up the topic. Oubre said he was enjoying himself in the moment while getting the best of some of his friends on the other side.\n\n\u201cIt was a fun game, man, because I know a lot of people on that team,\u201d Oubre said. \u201cStanley Johnson is like a brother to me. L.G. [Langston Galloway], we\u2019re both from Louisiana. Dre [Andre Drummond], Eric Moreland, he\u2019s from Houston. That team is sprinkled with a lot of people from my past.

From recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital to the cutoff of aid to Palestinians, President Donald Trump has given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the unprecedented gift of strong U.S. Alignment with a nationalist Israeli government. (Sebastian Scheiner, File/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 From recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital to cutting aid to Palestinians, President Donald Trump has given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the unprecedented gift of strong U.S. alignment with a nationalist Israeli government.\n\nWith the two leaders in sync personally and politically, Israel has become one of Trump\u2019s strongest supporters on the global stage. But this friendship also has unleashed forces that could harm Israel in the long run by damaging its traditional bipartisan support in Washington and propelling it onto a risky path toward a binational state with the Palestinians.\n\nThis week\u2019s decision by Trump to suspend $65 million in funding to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees and their descendants was the latest in a series of steps by the president that have embraced Israel\u2019s positions toward the Palestinians.\n\nFor Netanyahu, it has been a welcome contrast to President Barack Obama, with whom he repeatedly clashed for eight years over West Bank settlement construction and Israel\u2019s tough line toward the Palestinians.\n\nTrump, while promising to pursue what he called the \u201cultimate deal\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians, has promised to reverse virtually everything Obama stood for.\n\nHis campaign platform made no mention of a Palestinian state, and his Middle East peace team, led by son-in-law Jared Kushner, is dominated by strong supporters of Israel, many of them Orthodox Jews with deep ties to the settlement movement.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has distanced himself from the two-state solution embraced by the international community since Israel and the Palestinians signed the Oslo interim peace accords in the 1990s. He says he would support such a solution only if both sides agree, giving Netanyahu\u2019s government, dominated by opponents of Palestinian statehood, an effective veto.\n\nTrump has voiced little opposition to Israel\u2019s continued settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem \u2014 lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians for their hoped-for state.\n\nBut the biggest game changer came last month when Trump, honoring a campaign promise, upended decades of U.S. policy by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and promising to relocate the U.S. Embassy to the city. The Palestinians also claim east Jerusalem, home to the city\u2019s most sensitive holy sites, as their capital.\n\nTrump said his decision merely recognized reality and was not meant to prejudge the final borders of the contested city. But the groundbreaking announcement was perceived far differently by the sides.\n\nNetanyahu said he was \u201cprofoundly grateful\u201d for Trump\u2019s \u201ccourageous\u201d decision.\n\nFor the Palestinians, the announcement was seen as unfairly siding with Israel on the most sensitive issue in a decades-old conflict. It drew angry condemnations, sparked weeks of sometimes deadly unrest, and prompted the Palestinians to declare Trump unfit as a Mideast mediator.\n\nTheir frustration boiled over in an angry speech this week by President Mahmoud Abbas, who mocked Trump and his peace team, declared the Oslo peace accords dead and pre-emptively rejected any peace plan that Trump\u2019s team may present. When Vice President Mike Pence visits next week, Abbas will be out of town and the Palestinians will not meet with him.\n\n\u201cHow can we trust this administration?\u201d Abbas said in a speech this week. \u201cThe unjust American position on Jerusalem has enticed the occupying power to persist in its arrogance and aggression against our people, our land and our holy sites,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has dug in his heels. In a Jan. 2 tweet, he described the Palestinians as ungrateful and threatened to cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid.\n\nHe followed through this week by suspending a $65 million payment to the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees and their descendants. The State Department said the U.S. wanted to see reforms in the organization, adding that the suspension was not a punishment.\n\nNetanyahu welcomed the move, though critics in Israel, including many security experts, have said it will backfire by causing hardship and instability in the Palestinian territories. Trump\u2019s long-awaited peace proposal, meanwhile, appears to be on hold.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s nationalist partners have been emboldened by these developments. Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home party, has called on the government to annex the 60 percent of the West Bank incorporating the Israeli settlements. Netanyahu\u2019s own Likud Party approved a similar proposal in a nonbinding vote.\n\nAriel Kahane, the diplomatic correspondent for the pro-settler newspaper Makor Rishon, said now is the time for Israel to persuade the U.S. \u201cto abandon the bilateral route\u201d with the Palestinians and step up settlement construction.\n\n\u201cIsrael needs to establish irreversible facts on the ground while it concomitantly tries to reach agreements with the Arab countries over the Palestinians\u2019 heads,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo the right-wing government: This is your opportunity.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Israel\u2019s right, after years of clashes with U.S. administrations over the settlements, may have an opportunity to barrel ahead with expanded construction. With over 600,000 Israelis living in the settlements spread throughout the occupied areas, it already would be difficult to carve out a Palestinian state that includes the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Stepped-up construction could stamp out that possibility for good.\n\nBut Israel\u2019s right wing has struggled to offer a viable long-term solution for the more than 2.5 million Palestinians living in these areas and 2 million others in Hamas-controlled Gaza. Combined with the Arab population in Israel, the number of Palestinians is near parity with Israel\u2019s Jewish population.\n\nWithout the establishment of a Palestinian state, the thinking goes, Israel will become a binational state that would no longer be able to remain a democracy with a decisive Jewish majority. Israel would then have to choose between giving Palestinians citizenship \u2014 threatening Israel\u2019s Jewish character \u2014 or creating an apartheid-like situation in which Jews have rights that Palestinians don\u2019t get.\n\nIsraeli nationalists have called for pressure-easing steps like developing the Palestinian economy, \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d at the grassroots level or giving expanded autonomy to Palestinians. But this would not resolve the deeper issue of the Palestinians\u2019 final status.\n\n\u201cThose in Israel (or Washington) celebrating the demise of Abbas as a partner and any chance for a Trump peace plan should think again,\u201d Dan Shapiro, Obama\u2019s ambassador to Israel, warned in the Haaretz daily. He said it is vital for the U.S. to keep pushing for a two-state solution.\n\nIsrael\u2019s alliance with Trump could also have deep long-term repercussions in the U.S., where Israel has long prided itself on bipartisan support in Washington and support from American Jews.\n\nThroughout Obama\u2019s term, Netanyahu signaled his preference for the Republicans. His close ties with Trump risk worsening that perception. Surveys show that most American Jews support the Democrats and tend to hold moderate to liberal political views.\n\n\u201cBy allying himself with Trump, Netanyahu sets the stage for a backlash that will hurt both Israel and Jews throughout the world,\u201d said Rabbi Jill Jacobs, executive director of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization based in the U.S.\n\nEytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Israel\u2019s Bar Ilan University, said Netanyahu must be wary of getting \u201ctoo friendly\u201d with Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit tricky, how to maintain a good relationship with Trump while at the same time not to alienate American Jewry and the Democrats. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFederman, the AP\u2019s bureau chief for Israel and the Palestinian territories, has covered the region since 2003.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ian Deitch in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nThe facade of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government ran out of funding at midnight, but you may not have noticed.\n\nIn fact, it could be several days before the full impact of the shutdown is fully felt by the public.\n\nGovernment agencies began the process of shutting down at midnight Friday after Congress failed to pass a spending bill to keep them operating. But not every government employee was sent home.\n\nFederal workers deemed \u201cessential\u201d are still on the job, and key government functions \u2014 such as national security operations and law enforcement work \u2014 remain up and running.\n\nOther agencies have residual funds that will keep them operating for several days. But if the shutdown drags on, they, too, could run out of money and have to close their doors.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what you can expect during the Government Shutdown of 2018:\n\nWhat\u2019s open?\n\nThe mail is still being delivered, Social Security checks are still being processed, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are still running, and veterans\u2019 hospitals are still operating.\n\nThe national monuments will remain accessible as will portions of many national parks. The Smithsonian Institution\u2019s museums and National Zoo are open for now, but could close as early as Monday.\n\nAirports are still operating, and air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officials are still on the job. But you could still run into some delays if you\u2019re traveling because \u201cnon-essential\u201d employees will be furloughed.\n\nYou can also travel by train. Even though Amtrak depends on federal subsidies, it also gets revenue from ticket sales and has managed to stay open during past shutdowns.\n\nWhat\u2019s closed?\n\nOnly \u201cessential\u201d government employees will report to work, so most federal agencies and departments are closed for now.\n\nThe IRS, for example, is expected to furlough 56% of its workers, which means most of the agency\u2019s programs will be shuttered. That includes the agency\u2019s helplines, which are turned off during the shutdown \u2014 a potential problem for taxpayers seeking guidance on massive changes this year.\n\nMost employees at other departments and agencies, such as the Department of Education, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, are furloughed, which means that ongoing investigations and programs will be temporarily halted.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency remains open, but just for a limited time.

He did not anticipate how the audience watching at home would react; polls indicated nothing but trouble ahead of the Republicans. The villains of the Trump-scripted drama, the Democrats, turned out to be a more formidable and unified bloc than he had anticipated. For those Democrats, any votes to keep open the government were conditioned on a deal to protect young people who came to the country illegally as children. Trump had seemed to agree to this demand before only to reverse himself later.\n\nEven the last-minute theatrics seemed weak. The delayed then canceled liftoff from the White House\u2019s South Lawn on a Marine helicopter! The postponed glitzy gala at the President\u2019s personal golf club in Palm Beach, Fla.! The motorcade delivering the top Democrat in the Senate to the White House gates! It all seemed like set pieces in a drama whose outcome was already known.\n\nAfter all, why spend the day amping up the crowd if the show ends not with a cliffhanger, but in going off a cliff? Despite its predictability, this was not the ending the White House had anticipated.\n\nFriday began lacking urgency. Yet there was more than a little apprehension among Republicans on Friday as a clock ticking down to a midnight shutdown in the corner of the three major cable networks. The White House dispatched its budget and legislative chiefs to spin reporters in the morning. But it was a latent fear, not anything that made the pulse race.\n\nAt the Capitol, there was amazement that two of the White House\u2019s most valuable players at that hour were preparing to do press over policy, shaming over substance. It was a made-for-TV moment if ever Trump produced one. But at what cost to the actual art of governing?\n\nLater, Trump summoned the top Democrat in the Senate to the White House for 90 minutes of one-on-one negotiating session in the afternoon. Tense talks gave way to promises to talk again in a few hours. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, made a brief statement about \u201cgood progress\u201d and went behind closed doors to see what, if any, deal was possible. Schumer, who is typically loquacious with reporters, was unusually curt. It was the first sign that both sides were looking for a lifeboat from the sinking raft of government.\n\nThe most curious thing about the Capitol on Friday afternoon, when no solution to the partisan stalemate was to be found, was just how quiet it was. While Schumer was at the White House, Senate Republicans took a leisurely lunch together, eating barbecue in a dining room across the corridor from the chamber doors. The congressional press corps lingered in the hallways, waiting for negotiation updates that never came and wondering if UberEats would deliver pizza directly to the Capitol.\n\nNever mind an imminent federal crisis: when lawmakers emerged from their offices \u2014 if only to do a quick hit for cable news on said crisis \u2014 they seemed serene, if a little dazed. Chalk it up to resignation.\n\n\u201cThe government shuts down in five hours and forty minutes and there\u2019s no solution,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate\u2019s second-ranking Republican, told reporters outside of his office as dusk fell on Capitol Hill. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether Senator Schumer is just determined to take it all down. I personally think they got so far out over their skis and now they\u2019re trying to save face.\u201d\n\nLater in the evening, after the vote was clearly doomed, the urgency finally reached a crescendo. To Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s right, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren was patting his shoulder in an effort to assure him that all was not lost. Bipartisanship was found, but far too late.\n\nEven so, Democrats recognized the peril at hand.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hard sell when McConnell doesn\u2019t have 50 votes in his own caucus,\u201d a senior Democratic aide scoffed, when asked about the drama. \u201cHe can\u2019t blame Democrats when Republicans aren\u2019t voting for it. And Trump\u2019s standing in the way of a bipartisan deal that could solve all of this.\u201d\n\nAs the clock hands ticked past midnight, Republicans Bob Corker, Jeff Flake and Lamar Alexander wandered into the Democratic scrum of nearly two dozen senators from both parties huddled around Schumer\u2019s desk, deep in spirited conversation. Hope for a last minute deal lingered; at one point, Schumer and Graham bumped fists. But the lawmakers were still there when the clock struck twelve and the government officially shut down.\n\nAt the Capitol and at the White House, officials and their senior aides knew the biggest unknown was the President himself. Trump wanted to look tough and savvy, the New York real estate mogul sent to Washington to shake up the town. He wanted to cow the Democrats and his own Republicans alike. An alpha male at his peak, at a landmark date on the calendar.\n\nThroughout the West Wing, aides had circled the date in red Sharpie. January 20, Saturday, marks the one-year anniversary of the President\u2019s inauguration. At just the moment when Trump sought to celebrate \u2014 at his private club in Florida, where tickets started at $100,000 per couple, no less \u2014 he was instead watching his government grind to a halt. White House officials said Friday morning that the President wouldn\u2019t depart until there was a deal, although few thought there were any real chances of the President failing to get something in hand.\n\nSome White House officials scoffed that the suggestion that the President was not well aware of the drama in the making. For years, he held court as a judge on a top reality show that approximated business acumen. Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker of another order. This, to the minds of Trump apologists, was the reason Americans elected him to this role. After all, during the campaign, he boasted that he alone could fix Washington, strike better deals and negotiate the United States to unmatched prosperity. This was his window to prove them right.\n\nShutdowns are seldom good politics, especially not for the party that controls the White House. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released midday Friday found much more peril in a shutdown for Republicans by a 20 percentage-point margin than Democrats. A separate poll from CNN, released a few hours later, found a similar 16 percentage-point gap.\n\nRepublicans have never before presided over a shutdown while in control of all levers of power in Washington, and they were already bracing for a tough 2018 election cycle without the prospect of things falling apart on their watch. To perhaps blunt the backlash, Republicans were pushing a coordinated message branding this \u201cthe Schumer Shutdown.\u201d Clever, yes. Defining, maybe.\n\nBut insulting Schumer was unlikely to shake loose his caucus, which in recent weeks has seen the number of members willing to vote against stopgap funding bills go from eight on Dec. 7 to 30 on Dec. 21. Internally, senior Democrats expected that number to have grown to at least 40 this week \u2014 enough to block any continued funding, even without expected Republican defections. The final vote was 50-49, far short of the 60 votes needed.\n\nThe fact that, as time was scarce and the two sides were not talking, they were posturing on blame spoke everything. There was silence between McConnell and Schumer for most of Friday. The White House said Trump was phoning Congress but declined to say who was picking up the phone on the other end. There was not even comity to be had when it came to scheduling a vote on the House-passed stopgap measure; everyone expected it to fail but no one could agree to when it would do so well after sundown. (The House version narrowly cleared its hurdle on Thursday night, sending a dead-on-arrival, four-week stopgap measure to the Senate.)\n\nAt first, House Republicans were told they were free to go home. Then, they were told to stay close by in case they needed to pass a brief patch for funding. The House is scheduled to be away from Washington next week, although aides to leadership said that was also negotiable. No one wanted to be among constituents who see the government closed for business while House members cut ribbons on post offices back home.\n\nAs the evening wore on, lawmakers \u2014 and their donors \u2014 started to sound the alarm a little louder. But hard work of compromise during the urgent, not the panicked. For most of Friday, it was open season on the other. The House attacked the Senate. The Senate attacked the White House. Republicans blamed Democrats. Each side absorbed the blow and then returned just as good as they got.\n\nThere was no scramble to find compromise. No one was offering sacrifice. The White House insisted this shutdown would be better than the last, that it wouldn\u2019t be quite as back as 2013. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this, we do not want a shutdown. But Mr. Schumer insists on it, he is in a position to force this on the American people,\u201d White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney told reporters. (Yes, that is the same Mulvaney who, during the 2013 standoff, fancied himself a charter member of the Shutdown Caucus.)\n\nAs a reminder that we live in a hyperpartisan, election-focused environment, most of the talk among leaders in both parties centered on who should carry the blame for a shutdown for most of the day. Republicans cast the responsibility on the Democrats, the minority party in both the House and Senate. Republicans concocted an elaborate trap for those Democrats: the House GOP linked funding for a lapsed children\u2019s health insurance program with the shutdown and dared the Democrats to vote against care for sick kids.\n\nThe Republican talking point cast the deal as a vote against the military in the name of helping children who came to the country illegally. That rhetoric was galling to some members of Congress. Question a man\u2019s judgment, fine. But his patriotism? That\u2019s a whole other matter.\n\nDemocrats in recent weeks have felt emboldened to make their demands. The President\u2019s polling remains mired in the muck. The Dreamers are increasingly organized. DACA is popular, inside both parties, and shows no sign of relenting, especially as its future is uncertain. \u201cWe are frustrated, obviously,\u201d White House legislative chief Marc Short said Friday. \u201cThey are hellbent on getting to a shutdown,\u201d he said of the Democrats.\n\nLeft unsaid? Trump set this in motion by ending the DACA program, promising to restore it if Congress brought him legislation and then balked when his far-right advisers erupted.\n\nThe White House also said the bipartisan deal being shopped in the Senate was fake news. \u201cThere is no bill. Show me the bill,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley scoffed.\n\nThen, a third possible message coming from the same 18 acres that make up the White House complex. Mulvaney sought to say DACA could wait. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you have to deal with DACA this week,\u201d he said at the White House.\n\nActually, that\u2019s not true. If Republicans need Democratic votes to keep open the doors of government, then DACA needs to be dealt with when the Democrats say so. Otherwise, getting to 60 votes required in the Senate is impossible. At the same time, Republicans were starting to splinter. Graham said he would not vote for another temporary funding plan.\u201dI am not going to support continuing this fiasco for 30 more days,\u201d Graham tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s time Congress stop the cycle of dysfunction, grow up, and act consistent with the values of a great nation.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, when reporters spotted him on the White House driveway and swarmed him, budget maven Mulvaney moved the goalpost of getting a funding deal in place to before businesses were supposed to open on Monday. He said Senators may opt to modify the House version \u2014 perhaps move it from a four-week to 10-day extension, for instance \u2014 thus requiring the House to vote again. \u201cIf the Senate changes anything, it\u2019s going to have to back to the House. Now in theory, the Senate could deal with it before midnight and the House could in some fashion deal with it before midnight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely that if the Senate makes any changes it would take the House a while to get everybody back for the vote.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the President was tweeting that he wanted to have a month-long delay. After the House version failed, the White House press secretary called those who blocked it \u201cobstructionist losers.\u201d\n\nMcConnell took the Senate floor ahead of the vote to demand his rivals drop their objections. But in doing so, he signaled that he wasn\u2019t even looking for anything durable, just another can kicked down the road. \u201cLet\u2019s fund the government for a full month so we can actually get something done,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nIn the Senate, where Democratic lawmakers privately questioned if they had overplayed their hand as they shuffled out of the Capitol on Thursday, doubts faded by Friday evening. The Republican effort to spin \u2014 not negotiate solutions \u2014 played right into Democrats\u2019 hands, senior Democrats felt. Republicans continued to sputter their objections and tried to make process their friend.\n\n\u201cThey have their fingerprints all over this,\u201d Ryan said of the Democrats.\u201dThis is legislative hostage-taking.\u201d\n\nMaybe. But they made their demands and Republicans would do well to remember them if they want government open on Monday morning.", "title": "How the Government Broke Down", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5110952/government-shutdown-donald-trump/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T05:43:14Z"}, {"textData": "The Acropolis in Athens.

The slide toward closure lacked for high drama: The Senate vote was all but predetermined, and since the shutdown began at the start of a weekend, many of the immediate effects will be muted for most Americans.\n\nStill, it comes with no shortage of embarrassment for the president and political risk for both parties, as they wager that voters will punish the other at the ballot box in November.\n\nSocial Security and most other safety net programs are unaffected by the lapse in federal spending authority. Critical government functions will continue, with uniformed service members, health inspectors and law enforcement officers set to work without pay. But if no deal is brokered before Monday, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed.\n\nAfter hours of closed-door meetings and phone calls, the Senate scheduled its late-night vote on a House-passed plan. It gained 50 votes to proceed to 48 against, but 60 were needed to break a Democratic filibuster. A handful of red-state Democrats crossing the aisle to support the measure, rather than take the politically-risky vote. Four Republicans voted in opposition.\n\nIn an unusual move, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell allowed the roll call to exceed 90 minutes \u2014 instead of the usual 20 or so \u2014 seemingly accommodating the numerous discussions among leaders and other lawmakers. Still as midnight passed and the calendar turned, there was no obvious off-ramp to the political stalemate. Each party expressed resolve in its position \u2014 and confidence that the other would suffer the wrath of voters.\n\nEven before the vote, Trump was pessimistic, tweeting, \u201cNot looking good\u201d and blaming the Democrats who he said actually wanted the shutdown \u201cto help diminish the success\u201d of the tax bill he and fellow Republicans pushed through last month.\n\nDemocrats balked on the measure in an effort to pressure on the White House to cut a deal to protect \u201cdreamer\u201d immigrants \u2014 who were brought to the country as children and are now here illegally \u2014 before their legal protection runs out in March.\n\nThe president watched the results from the White House residence, dialing up allies and affirming his belief that Democrats would take the blame for the shutdown, said a person familiar with his conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nPredictably, both parties moved swiftly to blame one another. Democrats laid fault with Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House and have struggled with building internal consensus. Republicans declared Democrats responsible, after they declined to provide the votes needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate over their desire to force the passage of legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation.\n\nRepublicans branded the confrontation a \u201cSchumer shutdown\u201d and argued that Democrats were harming fellow Americans to protect \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nTrump had brought Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to the White House Friday afternoon in hopes of cutting a deal. But the two New Yorkers, who pride themselves on their negotiating abilities, emerged without an agreement, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress continued to pass off responsibility.\n\n\u201cWe made some progress, but we still have a good number of disagreements,\u201d Schumer said upon returning to Capitol Hill. Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told CNN that \u201cNot much has changed\u201d over the course of the day, but he predicted a deal would be reached by Monday, when most government offices are to reopen after the weekend.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate had served notice they would filibuster the government-wide funding bill that cleared the House Thursday evening. They were seeking an even shorter extension that they think would keep the pressure on the White House to cut a deal to protect the \u201cdreamer\u201d immigrants.\n\nTrump first described his discussion with Schumer as an \u201cexcellent preliminary meeting,\u201d tweeting that lawmakers were \u201cmaking progress \u2013 four week extension would be best!\u201d But that optimism faded as the evening wore on.\n\nSenate GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas said Trump told Schumer to work things out with McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. McConnell did not attend the meeting because he was not invited, a Senate GOP aide said.\n\nTrump had been an unreliable negotiator in the weeks leading up to the showdown. Earlier this week he tweeted opposition to the four-week plan, forcing the White House to later affirm his support. He expressed openness to extending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, only to reject a bipartisan proposal. His disparaging remarks about African and Haitian immigrants last week helped derail further negotiations.\n\nTrump had been set to leave Friday afternoon to attend a fundraiser at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate marking the one-year anniversary of his inauguration but delayed his travel.\n\n\u201cI think the president\u2019s been very clear: he\u2019s not leaving until this is finished,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters.\n\nAs word of the Schumer meeting spread, the White House hastened to reassure Republican congressional leaders that Trump would not make any major policy concessions, said a person familiar with the conversations but not authorized to be quoted by name.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, McConnell said Americans at home would be watching to see \u201cwhich senators make the patriotic decision\u201d and which \u201cvote to shove aside veterans, military families and vulnerable children to hold the entire country hostage\u2026 until we pass an immigration bill.\u201d\n\nAcross the Capitol, the House backed away from a plan to adjourn for a one-week recess, meaning the GOP-controlled chamber could wait for a last-minute compromise that would require a new vote. But it wasn\u2019t coming Friday night.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep kicking the can down the road,\u201d said Schumer, insisting on more urgency in talks on immigration. \u201cIn another month, we\u2019ll be right back here, at this moment, with the same web of problems at our feet, in no better position to solve them.\u201d\n\nThe four-week measure would have been the fourth stopgap spending bill since the current budget year started in October. A pile of unfinished Capitol Hill business has been on hold, first as Republicans ironed out last fall\u2019s tax bill and now as Democrats insist on progress on immigration. Talks on a budget deal to ease tight spending limits on both the Pentagon and domestic agencies are on hold, as is progress on a huge $80 billion-plus disaster aid bill.\n\nBefore Thursday night\u2019s House approval, GOP leaders sweetened the stopgap measure with legislation to extend for six years a popular health care program for children from low-income families and two-year delays in unpopular \u201cObamacare\u201d taxes on medical devices and generous employer-provided health plans.\n\nA shutdown would be the first since 2013, when tea party Republicans \u2014 in a strategy not unlike the one Schumer is employing now \u2014 sought to use a must-pass funding bill to try to force then-President Barack Obama to delay implementation of his marquee health care law. At the time, Trump told Fox & Friends that the ultimate blame for a shutdown lies at the top. \u201cI really think the pressure is on the president,\u201d he said.\n\nArguing that Trump\u2019s predecessors \u201cweaponized\u201d that shutdown, Mulvaney said Friday the budget office would direct agencies to work to mitigate the impact this time. That position is a striking role-reversal for the conservative former congressman, who was one of the architects of the 2013 shutdown over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWith no agreement by midnight, the government would begin immediately locking its doors. The impact would initially be spotty \u2014 since most agencies would be closed until Monday \u2014 but each party would be gambling the public would blame the other.\n\nIn the event of a shutdown, food inspections, federal law enforcement, airport security checks, and other vital services would continue, as would Social Security, other federal benefit programs and military operations.", "title": "U.S. Government Shuts Down as Democrats and Republicans Trade Blame", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5111018/government-shutdown-senate/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T05:22:54Z"}, {"textData": "Funding for the government expired at midnight on Jan. 20 after a short-term spending bill failed in the Senate.

Because, as The Post's Paul Kane points out, recent shutdowns have only ended when one side realized they were getting blamed for it.\n\n\u201cIf there is to be a shutdown, Democrats won't have a lot of options,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top Senate Democratic aide, hours before the Senate rejected a bill to keep the government open for another month. \u201cIf Democrats hang together, at some point Republicans will have to compromise, if as I expect the public blames them for what happens.\u201d\n\nRepublicans' strategy is basically the exact opposite.\n\n\u201cBlame Dems,\u201d said Steve Bell, a former Senate GOP budget aide, in an email of what Republicans can do to try to end the shutdown.\n\nIn the meantime, the Senate will likely take repeat votes on a short-term spending bill, and, Manley predicted, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will hope that with each vote, more Democrats change their mind and vote in favor of a four-week spending bill.\n\nIn the vote that spurred this shutdown, five out of 48 Senate Democrats voted with Republicans. All five \u2014 Sens. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Doug Jones (Ala.) \u2014 are up for reelection in states that Trump won by double digits in November.\n\nMcConnell can hope other potentially vulnerable Democrats in November, like Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Bill Nelson (Fla.), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Robert P. Casey Jr. (Pa.) could change their minds the longer this shutdown goes on.\n\nThe thinking is that the American public will recognize that Democrats voted to shut down the government in January over a deal to protect \u201cdreamers,\u201d whose protections don't expire until March.\n\nJosh Holmes, a former top aide to McConnell, points to recent history to make the case that Democrats are the ones to blame: In 2013, conservative Republicans refused to vote for a spending bill that did not defund Obamacare. The government shut down for 16 days, and polls showed a majority of Americans blamed Republicans.\n\n\u201cYou take the party label off and watch how that's played out,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cIt's never been good for the party that's blocking the funding for reasons irrelevant to the funding.\u201d\n\nBut the strategy where Republicans come out on top would also likely require public opinion to change. A Washington Post-ABC News poll on Friday found Americans would blame Trump and Republicans over Democrats by a 20-point margin.\n\n\n\nTrump will likely be the focus of a major part of the blame. He's been extremely, and publicly, inconsistent about what he wants in an immigration or spending bill.\n\nPlus, it's just going to be more difficult for Republicans to explain why the government shut down when they control Congress and the White House.\n\nBut until there's a clear direction on public opinion about which party shut down the government, expect both sides to spend this shutdown trying to convince you that they're right and the other guys are wrong. They've already thrown negotiations out the window, so that's their only option to end this stalemate.", "title": "The government just shut down.

But he said women are nevertheless victims of \u201cfemicide and many situations of violence that are kept quiet behind so many walls.\u201d (Alessandra Tarantino/Associated Press)\n\nTRUJILLO, Peru \u2014 Pope Francis denounced femicides and other gender-based crimes that have turned Latin America into the most violent place on Earth for women, calling Saturday for legislation to protect them and a new cultural mindset as he visited one of Peru\u2019s most dangerous parts.\n\nAt a Marian prayer in the northern seaside city of Trujillo, Francis called women, mothers and grandmothers the guiding force for families. And yet, he said, in the Americas they are too often victims of murder and \u201cmany situations of violence that are kept quiet behind so many walls.\u201d\n\nThe first Latin American pope called for lawmakers to protect women and for a new culture \u201cthat repudiates every form of violence.\u201d His remarks came the same day large crowds marched throughout the United States and other countries in support of female empowerment.\n\nFrancis\u2019 use of the term femicide \u2014 the killing of women where the motive is directly related to gender\u2014 marked the second time in as many days that he has spoken out against \u201cmachismo\u201d culture in Latin America. The region has the dubious honor of having the world\u2019s highest rates of violence against women occurring outside romantic partnerships, and the second-highest within.\n\nEven though more and more countries in the region are adopting protective policies for women, female homicides are rising in Latin America with two in every five resulting from domestic violence, according to a November 2017 report from U.N. Women and the U.N. Development Program that called the phenomenon a \u201cglobal pandemic.\u201d\n\nIn recent years women have taken to the streets across Latin America, including in Peru, to protest gender violence as part of the international \u201cNi Una Menos\u201d or \u201cNot One Less\u201d campaign.\n\nIn the Peruvian Amazon this week, Francis denounced forced prostitution and the trafficking of women in the area, saying it pained him how they are \u201cdevalued, denigrated and exposed to endless violence.\n\n\u201cViolence against women cannot be treated as \u2018normal,\u2019 maintaining a culture of machismo blind to the leading role that women play in our communities,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cIt is not right for us to look the other way and let the dignity of so many women, especially young women, be trampled upon.\u201d\n\nFrancis\u2019 decision to directly address the issue followed a reticence to speak out last year when he visited Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican border city notorious for hundreds of killings of women that brought international attention to the problem. More than 100 women died in eerily similar killings in the city across from El Paso, Texas, starting in 1993, although the serial or copycat nature of them tapered off a decade later.\n\nAt a 2016 open-air mass in Juarez, Francis made an emotional plea to recognize the \u201chuman tragedy\u201d of the treatment of migrants but made only a passing mention of the women\u2019s killings. At the time he did not use the word \u201cfemicide,\u201d saying only, \u201cAnd what can we say about so many women who have unjustly had their lives taken?\u201d\n\nMothers of some of the Juarez victims had sought unsuccessfully to meet with Francis, and Saturday marked the first time he is known to have used the term \u201cfemicide\u201d in public.\n\nCentral American countries have the highest rates of gender-based violence, but the issue is also a serious problem in Peru. More than 1,000 women died from gender violence in the South American country from 2009 through last October \u2014 the vast majority murdered by a partner or relative \u2014 according to a report by the Public Ministry.\n\nFrancis\u2019 comments came in his final event in Trujillo, where devastating floods last year killed more than 150 people and destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes.\n\nAt a seaside Mass for some 200,000 faithful, Francis said he came to pray with those who lost everything and who must also contend with the \u201cother storms that can hit these coasts, with devastating effects on the lives of the children of these lands.\u201d\n\nHe cited organized violence and contract killings, a major problem in Peru and in the north in particular. Extortion is also common in the area, especially around Trujillo and parts hit hardest by the floods, and bus drivers who refuse to pay often see their minibuses torched.\n\nFrancis said Peruvians have shown life\u2019s greatest problems can be confronted when communities come together \u201cto help one another like true brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nIn Trujillo the pope found a frustrated population hoping his visit could quicken reconstruction from Peru\u2019s worst environmental disaster in nearly two decades. Of the 200,000 homes destroyed in last year\u2019s floods, only about 60 percent have been repaired, said Edwin Trujillo, an emergency coordinator for the Peruvian Red Cross.\n\n\u201cPeople are furious because authorities haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d said Carlos Bocanegra, 60, a biologist who lives in Trujillo.\n\nFrancis is the second pope to visit the city. He follows in the footsteps of St. John Paul II, who came here in 1985, a decade when Peru was afflicted not only by El Nino floods but also hyperinflation and political violence.\n\nThree decades later many of the same inequalities that existed back then remain entrenched, with poor, rural areas still unprepared to face the damage caused by environmental calamity.\n\nMany in northern Peru lament that streets are still contaminated by fungus and filled with debris from the storms, estimated to have cause several billion dollars in damage.\n\n\u201cFor us it is a blessing that Pope Francis has come to Buenos Aires to see everything we have suffered,\u201d said Carlos Covenas, who lives in the small Peruvian town that shares the name of Francis\u2019 Argentine birthplace.\n\nWhile Francis has received a decidedly warm welcome in Peru, his tumultuous visit to Chile earlier this week continued to cast a shadow. Authorities said Saturday that another church had been destroyed in a blaze 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of the Chilean capital, Santiago, following a string of fires to religious buildings that started even before Francis landed in that country.\n\nFrancis\u2019 top adviser on clerical sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, also implicitly rebuked the pontiff Saturday over remarks he made upon leaving Chile two days earlier. Francis accused victims of the country\u2019s most notorious pedophile priest of having slandered another bishop, Juan Barros. The victims say Barros knew about the abuse and did nothing to stop it \u2014 a charge Barros denies.\n\nO\u2019Malley, archbishop of Boston, called Francis\u2019 words \u201ca source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Nicole Winfield reported from Trujillo, and AP writer Christine Armario reported from Lima, Peru.

(Park Dong-joo/Yonhap via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea on Saturday proposed sending a delegation led by the leader of a hugely popular girl band to South Korea to check preparations for a trip by a North Korean art troupe during next month\u2019s Winter Olympics.\n\nThe new proposal came less than 24 hours after North Korea canceled the delegation\u2019s visit.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said it had accepted the proposal for the two-day visit starting Sunday.\n\nEarlier in the day the ministry had requested the North to explain why it abruptly canceled the visit by the seven-member advance team on late Friday, just hours after proposing it through a cross-border communication channel.\n\nThe delegation will be led by the art troupe\u2019s leader Hyon Song Wol. She also heads the hugely popular girl band Moranbong, which is hand-picked by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe rival Koreas earlier this week agreed that the little-known 140-member art troupe, Samjiyon, which will include singers, dancers and orchestra members, will perform twice in South Korea during the Games in a sign of warming ties between the countries. It will be part of a North Korean Olympic delegation that will also include athletes, officials, state media reporters, a cheering group and a taekwondo demonstration team.\n\nThe countries also agreed to hold a joint cultural event at the North\u2019s scenic Diamond Mountain and a training session between non-Olympic skiers at the North\u2019s Masik ski resort ahead of the Olympics. The North has yet to respond to the South Korean proposal to send a 12-member delegation to the North on Tuesday to inspect preparations for the events.\n\nHyon has been the focus of intense South Korean media interest since she attended inter-Korean talks at the border on Monday that reached agreement on the troupe\u2019s visit. Hyon\u2019s gestures during the talks as well as her makeup, looks, navy blue suit and green shoulder bag received widespread coverage.\n\nThe reconciliation mood between the Koreas began after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year\u2019s speech that he was willing to send a delegation to the Olympics. While South Korea hopes to use the games to improve relations with its rival after a year of animosity over North Korea\u2019s rapidly expanding nuclear program, some experts view Kim\u2019s overture as an attempt to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and buy time to further advance his nuclear weapons program.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Shawn Thew, EPA-EFE)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate blocked a short-term spending bill Friday night, causing a partial government shutdown to begin at midnight.\n\nGovernment agencies began ramping down operations Saturday, the one-year anniversary of President Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe shutdown could be short-lived. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed early Saturday to keep the Senate in session, and the House was scheduled to reconvene at 9 a.m. Saturday to be ready to vote on whatever the Senate may pass.\n\nMcConnell announced that he would offer a new option to keep the government funded through Feb. 8, rather than the Feb. 16 date that the rejected bill would have set. It was not immediately clear when the Senate would vote on that plan.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said \"there is a path forward.\"\n\n\"We can reach it quickly (Saturday),\" he said. \"The president and the four leaders should immediately sit down and finish this deal so the entire government can get back to work on Monday.\"\n\nMcConnell said \"we\u2019ll vote again so the American people know who stands for them.\"\n\nSaturday morning, Trump blamed Democrats\u2019 concern for illegal immigrants for the shutdown in a tweet saying \"They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead.\n\nMcConnell held Friday's vote open for more than two hours, but opponents \u2014 including a handful of Republicans \u2014 had already cast more than enough votes to scuttle it. The final tally was 50-49. That was 10 votes short of the 60 needed to advance the bill.\n\nThe vote began less than two hours before government funding was set to expire and came after hours of negotiations that saw lawmakers scrambling in vain to reach a deal.\n\nMore than 100 onlookers watched the spectacle from the balconies above the Senate floor.\n\nMost Senate Democrats opposed a House-approved spending bill because it wouldn't prevent the deportation of about 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Democratic leaders had vowed not to support a funding deal unless it protected the young immigrants.\n\nTrump blasted Democrats in a tweet Friday night, accusing them of wanting to cause a shutdown to take attention away from the success of the tax cuts recently passed by the GOP-led Congress.\n\nNot looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border.

Joe Manchin, D-W.V., who is up for re-election in a state Trump won by 42 points, was one of a handful of Democrats who voted to advance the bill. The other Democrats who voted for it were: Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri.\n\nRepublicans who voted against the bill were: Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nJust ahead of the vote, Manchin was asked if he thought Democrats were being reasonable: \"I think in their minds they\u2019re being reasonable. The same as I think Republicans who are taking a hard-line stance think they\u2019re being reasonable.\"\n\nThe House had passed the spending bill Thursday to funded the government through Feb. 16, giving lawmakers more time to work out a compromise on legislation to fund federal agencies through September. It also would have reauthorized for six years the Children's Health Insurance Program, which helps states pay for health care for low-income kids.\n\nA shutdown likely means that most federal agencies will close and hundreds of thousands of government workers will be furloughed unless Congress can pass a funding bill this weekend.\n\nFederal workers deemed \"essential\" would stay on the job and military and homeland security operations would remain up and running.\n\nThe Trump administration said that most national park sites would remain open through the weekend, but would begin closing Monday if a funding deal is not reached by then.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats were rushing to blame each other.\n\nCLOSE A government shutdown could have an impact on everything from your passport application to those beloved Panda cams.

The bill, which needed 60 votes to proceed, failed in a 50-49 vote, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0(R-Ky.) voting against it for procedural reasons.\u00a0\nLeaders in both chambers haven\u2019t settled on a Plan B. There\u2019s no deal to help so-called Dreamers and no agreement on an even shorter-term bill to extend funding while they work on one. There\u2019s not even certainty about what Trump actually wants. Earlier in the day, he rejected an offer from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to fund his border wall, the Democrat said.\u00a0Senators remained in the chamber discussing a path forward but didn\u2019t find one before the deadline.\u00a0\nEventually, the Senate adjourned without a deal and will have to return later Saturday.\u00a0\nIt will be difficult to reach a long-term deal to reopen the government. Democrats want protections for Dreamers first, but White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that\u2019s not something the administration will discuss until government funding is approved.\u00a0\n\u201cWe will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands,\u201d she said in a statement just before midnight. \u201cThis is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators. When Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform.\u201d\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t just Democrats who voted against the bill.\u00a0Four Republicans also opposed the four-week funding measure: Sens.

Then GOP leaders in the Senate decided to hold a vote on that funding measure even though it was clear minutes before that it didn\u2019t have the support the pass \u2015 essentially daring Democrats to vote no.\nNegotiations over a last-minute deal to extend funding for the government through\u00a0Feb. 8\u00a0\u2015 one week earlier than the House-passed bill \u2015 collapsed shortly before\u00a0midnight\u00a0after Democrats were unable to secure a commitment from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to attach a DACA measure to a must-pass government funding bill next month, according to senators of both parties. Without the commitment, Democrats would have no guarantee that Republicans would vote on DACA before the program expires in March.\nMcConnell criticized Democrats after the vote for \u201cshoehorning of illegal immigration into this debate.\u201d\u00a0\nSenators are expected to return to work\u00a0Saturday\u00a0in hopes of reaching a deal\u00a0 by\u00a0Monday,\u00a0when most federal employees return to work.\n\nTrump necessitated a legislative fix for so-called Dreamers when he ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September,\u00a0putting them at risk of losing work permits and deportation relief.\nRepublicans insisted there\u2019s no urgency on immigration. But Democrats, at the urging of Dreamers themselves, stood firm, even though many of them voted for a spending bill in December. At a time when Trump is simultaneously insisting he wants an immigration deal and making demands that Democrats find difficult to stomach \u2015 reportedly discussing immigrants in racist terms and insulting the lawmakers he is negotiating with \u2015 they argued that tying DACA to government funding is the best chance they have to do so. \nOn Friday, ahead of the vote, Schumer went to the White House to meet with Trump to discuss the deal in person. Schumer said that he offered Trump funding for his border wall \u2015 something he and other Democrats have said no to repeatedly. He also told him Democrats would agree to higher defense spending, according to a source familiar with the conversation, who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting. They parted without a firm deal, but the president said that a short-term spending bill, as proposed by Schumer, was a good idea, the source said.\u00a0\nBut later,\u00a0it fell apart. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly called Schumer and said the proposal he had discussed with Trump was too liberal, according to the source.\u00a0\u00a0\nTrump tweeted after the meeting that it was \u201cexcellent\u201d but hours later was back to publicly bashing Democrats, accusing them of wanting \u201ca Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.\u201d\nSchumer accused Trump of turning on a bipartisan deal as if he was \u201crooting for a shutdown.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now we\u2019ll have one, and the blame should crash entirely on President Trump\u2019s shoulders.\u201d\nTrump lashed out at Democrats in series of tweets early Saturday,\u00a0saying that they \u201ccould have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead.\u201d\nDemocrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2018\n\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Democrats who blocked the bill, and DACA wasn\u2019t the only thing keeping lawmakers from supporting the spending bill. Some senators said they wouldn\u2019t vote for another one-month spending bill because they view it as an irresponsible way to run the government. Such measures, called continuing resolutions, are in lieu of a full-year bill to fund the government because lawmakers have yet to reach a deal.\n\nYoung people are set to begin losing DACA protections in larger numbers in early March, although about 122 per day have been losing their shield against deportation since Trump rescinded the program. (The government is currently accepting renewal applications because of a court order, but aims to have that ruling overturned.)\nNegotiations on a deal for Dreamers hit a skid last week, when Trump reportedly made racist and derisive statements about immigrants from African nations and Haiti. (Trump has denied making those comments. However, he wants to eliminate a program that grants visas to many African immigrants and ended temporary protected status that allows some Haitians already in the U.S. to remain here.)\nTrump also rejected a bipartisan proposal from senators, most prominently Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Graham, intended to conform to the president\u2019s demands. The White House hasn\u2019t voiced support for a bipartisan House proposal from Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.). And a separate effort to find a deal between the second-ranking members in each party in the House and Senate hasn\u2019t led to an agreement.\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) spun the night\u2019s developments in a positive light, predicting the failed vote would eventually drive both sides to settle on a bipartisan compromise.\n\u201cThis is what makes Congress work,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cSooner or later they can get tired of it, then they\u2019ll say let\u2019s quit playing around and get something done.\u201d\nHe added, somewhat facetiously: \u201cIsn\u2019t this fun?\u201d\n", "title": "A shutdown is imminent after a key Republican vote failed in the Senate.", "sourceId": "the-huffington-post", "sourceName": "The Huffington Post", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-blocks-government-funding-shutdown-looms_us_5a61534ee4b0125fd635543a", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T04:25:53Z"}, {"textData": "Rocker Tom Petty died in October due to an accidental overdose of seven medications, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's office said.

He told Rolling Stone at the time that the tour might be his last. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend my life on the road,\u201d he said.\n\nPetty\u2019s wife, Dana Petty, and his daughter, Adria Petty, wrote in a statement posted to the band\u2019s website and Facebook page that Petty had suffered from emphysema, knee problems and a fractured hip. Out of commitment to his fans, he toured for 53 dates with the fractured hip. But the pain soon became unbearable and led Petty to turn to medication, the family said.\n\n\u201cWe knew before the report was shared with us that he was prescribed various pain medications for a multitude of issues including Fentanyl patches and we feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident,\u201d the family wrote.\n\nOur family sat together this morning with the Medical Examiner \u2013 Coroner\u2019s office and we were informed of their final\u2026 Posted by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on Friday, January 19, 2018\n\nThe family shared the coroner\u2019s report to \u201cspark a further discussion on the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope in some way this report can save lives,\u201d the family wrote.\n\nFentanyl, a synthetic narcotic about 50 times stronger than heroin, is linked to thousands of overdoses and fatalities across the country. Fentanyl-related deaths increased nearly 600 percent from 2014 to 2016 in 24 of the nation\u2019s biggest cities, according to health departments. A report by The Washington Post last year showed 582 fatal overdoses from fentanyl in 2014, followed by a surge to 3,946 such deaths in 2016.\n\n[Tom Petty was a heroin addict in the \u201990s. Here\u2019s why he\u2019s finally talking about it.]\n\nPetty in 2015 opened up about his addiction to heroin in the 1990s. Petty for decades had kept the addiction a secret and, before talking about it to biographer Warren Zanes, told him: \u201cI am very concerned that talking about this is putting a bad example out there for young people. If anyone is going to think heroin is an option because they know my story of using heroin, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to come off as a cautionary tale rather than a romantic tale,\u201d Zanes recalled telling Petty, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Geoff Edgers.\n\nLegendary recording artist Tom Petty died at a Los Angeles hospital on Oct. 2 at the age of 66, after being found unconscious at his Malibu home.

(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nTwitter says it will notify nearly 700,000 users who interacted with accounts the company has identified as potential pieces of a propaganda effort by the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe company on Friday also disclosed thousands of accounts that it said were associated with the Kremlin-linked troll farm, the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian government, adding to numbers that it released to Congress in October.\n\nTwitter said that it had identified 3,814 IRA-linked accounts, which posted some 176,000 tweets in the 10 weeks preceding the election, and another 50,258 automated accounts connected to the Russian government, which tweeted more than a million times, while acknowledging that \u201csuch activity represents a challenge to democratic societies everywhere,\u201d in a news release Friday afternoon.\n\nThe disclosures are the latest sign of how widely the effort to disrupt the 2016 election through disinformation permeated the services of social media companies, including Twitter, Facebook and Google. And it is yet another instance where Twitter appears to be adjusting its service in the wake of cultural shifts exposed by Russian meddling.\n\n[Doubting the intelligence, Trump pursues Putin and leaves a Russian threat unchecked]\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia conducted a sophisticated campaign intended to affect the outcome of the election, which included spreading propaganda and incendiary reports on social media about subjects like police brutality, Black Lives Matter, Muslim rights and veterans issues, and hacking Democratic officials to sow discord in the country.\n\nTwitter has been criticized for reacting slowly to the proliferation of disinformation and bad-faith accounts on the service: @TEN_GOP, an influential troll account that amassed a large following on the service by bolstering pro-Trump messages and misinformation, was reportedly the subject of impersonation complaints by the actual Republican Party of Tennessee for nearly a year before the company closed it last August, for example.\n\nThe company, along with Facebook and Google, was excoriated by lawmakers during a series of hearings on Capitol Hill in the fall, some of whom threatened legislation to address the lingering national security issues if the companies failed to take steps of their own.\n\nAt the time, Facebook acknowledged that as many as 126 million users may have seen content produced and circulated by Russian operatives. And Google disclosed for the first time that it had found 1,108 videos with 43 hours of content related to the Russian effort on YouTube.\n\n@TEN_GOP, believed to be run by the Kremlin-linked troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, had more than 130,000 followers. (Twitter)\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner, a Democrat from Virginia who previously has been critical of Twitter, praised its move to notify users on Friday, saying he was \u201cencouraged to see the company beginning to take responsibility.\u201d\n\nTwitter spokeswoman Emily Horne said the company planned to send the notification to some 677,000 users who followed or engaged with Russian or IRA-linked accounts, but she declined to provide information on its contents.\n\nThe company also highlighted the changes it had made to its internal policing efforts, saying that it currently blocks about 250,000 logins that come from automated accounts a day. It said that in December, updated methodology allowed it to identify about 6.4 million suspicious accounts around the world per week. And the company sought to underline how small a portion of the activity on Twitter these accounts represented before the accounts were removed.\n\nBut there are some indications that malicious use of the service continues.\n\nAs the effort lead by some Republicans to curtail special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into the election meddling has heated up, Russian-linked accounts helped amplify a Twitter hashtag calling for the release of a memo the group hopes will help discredit Mueller's work, according to Hamilton 68, a research firm that tracks the malicious accounts.

Khe Sanh figured prominently in the plans of both. The anchor of the American stronghold at Khe Sanh was a Marine combat base perched on a plateau between an old French road, Route 9, and the Rao Quan River, about seven miles east of the border with Laos and 15 miles south of the demilitarized zone dividing North Vietnam from South. A fan-shaped array of outposts, including an American Army Special Forces camp, guarded approaches to the base from the north and west.\n\nIn January 1968, two North Vietnamese Army divisions \u2014 some 20,000 men \u2014 converged on Khe Sanh from the west. Another division moved to a position northeast of Khe Sanh.\n\nThe first phase of the North Vietnamese plan, \u201cGeneral Offensive and General Uprising,\u201d called for Communist troops to provoke a series of interior battles to lure American forces from the populous coast. One of those battles was to occur at Khe Sanh.\n\nBut the ruling Politburo in Hanoi had split over the next phase. A faction led by the ascendant Le Duan, the general secretary of the Central Committee, called for urban attacks aimed at igniting a popular uprising. In opposition to that risky approach were North Vietnam\u2019s aging revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh, and his military chief, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, architect of the victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Ultimately, Le Duan outflanked his opponents and the urban offensive was incorporated into the plan. The attacks on southern cities were to unfold as Vietnam celebrated the lunar new year \u2014 Tet \u2014 in late January 1968.\n\nIn Saigon, General Westmoreland welcomed the Communist move against Khe Sanh. He laid plans for an unprecedented artillery and air response to cripple his North Vietnamese adversaries in a rare conventional confrontation.\n\nThe drama at Khe Sanh got underway with a flurry of N.V.A. attacks in the early hours of Sunday, Jan. 21. An enemy ground assault penetrated a Marine outpost on Hill 861 before failing. Communist artillery bombarded Khe Sanh Combat Base, detonating the main ammunition dump. Other North Vietnamese troops attacked the district headquarters compound in nearby Khe Sanh village.\n\nOver the next two weeks, the base and its outposts endured daily barrages and sniper fire. At night, N.V.A. soldiers probed Khe Sanh\u2019s defenses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConcerns of a massive ground assault on Khe Sanh increased after the Communist urban attacks began on Jan. 31. The following day, President Johnson\u2019s chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Earle Wheeler, asked General Westmoreland whether tactical nuclear weapons might be required to save Khe Sanh. Westmoreland hedged his bets. In a worst-case scenario, he said in a secret cable, \u201cI visualize that either tactical nuclear weapons or chemical agents would be active candidates for employment.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 5, as fighting continued in Saigon, Hue and other cities, the North Vietnamese attacked a key Khe Sanh outpost on Hill 861 Alpha. Communist forces pierced the Marine perimeter, but the attack was finally broken by a massive artillery barrage aided by electronic sensors and punctuated with a ground counterattack. The following night, the Army Special Forces camp southwest of the base was overrun in a ground assault supported by 11 Russian-made PT-76 light tanks. On Feb. 8, N.V.A. soldiers attacked a small Marine outpost barely a mile southwest of the base.\n\nCommunist forces set to work encircling the base with trenches and concealed gun positions, imperiling the stronghold\u2019s aerial supply lifeline. In Washington, retired Gen. Maxwell Taylor, a respected World War II veteran and former ambassador to South Vietnam, advised President Johnson to abandon Khe Sanh. Food and water were rationed in the outposts, and wounded men sometimes died awaiting helicopter evacuation flights. The sense of crisis deepened on Feb. 10 when a Marine C-130 transport was hit by enemy fire and forced to crash-land at Khe Sanh, killing eight Americans.\n\nThat same week, unknown to General Westmoreland and the Marines, Communist commanders shifted a third of their siege force from Khe Sanh to the battle for Hue, 50 miles to the southeast. Years after the war, Westmoreland\u2019s intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Phillip B. Davidson Jr., remained baffled by the decision. The North Vietnamese \u201ckept too many troops at Khe Sanh just to threaten it, and too few to overrun it.\u201d It is one of many unsolved mysteries that still shroud the battle for Khe Sanh.\n\nThe siege reached its climax in the last week of February 1968, although this, too, became evident only much later.\n\nOn Feb. 24, American forces launched Operation Sierra, colloquially known as the Super Gaggle, for the large number of aircraft involved. It involved inundating enemy gun positions around Khe Sanh with tear gas, smoke, high explosives and napalm, allowing big Sea Knight helicopters to swoop in to the hilltop outposts and drop external nets packed with supplies. The resupply crisis eased.\n\nThe following day, fear of an imminent assault on the base peaked after the decimation of a Marine patrol and discovery of new Communist trenches extending to within a few yards of the southeastern perimeter wire. On the night of Feb. 29, N.V.A. forces undertook three waves of attacks on the eastern perimeter of Khe Sanh Combat Base. The Americans activated an elaborate plan to trap and slaughter Communist forces with coordinated B-52 strikes and other air and artillery missions. A few N.V.A. soldiers reached the perimeter wire before the final attack failed.\n\nNorth Vietnamese pressure on Khe Sanh eased in March as improved weather resulted in even heavier American air and artillery attacks. With the arrival of a joint Army-Marine relief force, American commanders declared an end to the siege on April 8.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the weeks ahead, the Army forces departed and fresh Marine battalions arrived, encountering even bloodier combat than during the siege. But by then the reporters had moved on, and General Westmoreland was on his way out, replaced by Gen. Creighton Abrams. In early July, Khe Sanh Combat Base was dismantled, and, in a scene that foreshadowed the events of April 1975, the last Americans left hurriedly by helicopter. North Vietnamese radio proclaimed victory at Khe Sanh.\n\nNearly 1,000 Americans died in the 1968 fighting around Khe Sanh (far more than the discredited official toll). Estimates of Communist losses ranged from 2,500 to 15,000 killed.\n\nThe full intentions of the North Vietnamese at Khe Sanh remain unclear. For decades, the Hanoi party line has held that Khe Sanh was solely a ruse to mask the urban attacks \u2014 a self-serving claim by ideologues who view history as a tool of the revolution rather than a search for objective truth. That claim has been amplified by respected Vietnam War correspondents such as Neil Sheehan and the late Stanley Karnow. Largely ignored is a competing analysis that contends the North Vietnamese intended to cap their 1968 offensive with the coup de gr\u00e2ce inflicted on the Americans at Khe Sanh.

To appreciate true genius is to see it uninhibited by exterior circumstances, to see it in its purest natural element. Sports are entertainment, and part of that entertainment is to see athletic genius at work. Why would we want to see a wonderful athlete unable to be his or her best because it\u2019s absurdly hot or cold outside? The beauty is in the performance, not what surrounds it.\n\nWould you appreciate, say, a Daniel Day-Lewis performance more because it was done in a storage freezer, or in the middle of a blazing desert? (Never mind that, knowing him, he\u2019d probably still win an Oscar.) Isn\u2019t the art itself enough?\n\nThe N.F.L. has constructed a whole cottage industry out of \u201cfrozen tundra\u201d as spectacle, all born from the infamous Ice Bowl of 1967, the N.F.L.

In the moment, it was virtually unwatchable and barely even resembled football. During the game, the Packers quarterback Bart Starr got frostbite in his fingers; the linebacker Ray Nitschke\u2019s frostbite was so awful, his toenails fell off. The marching band in attendance couldn\u2019t play because the woodwinds froze.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter whistling for kickoff, the referee Norm Schachter realized that his whistle was stuck to his lips; when he tried to remove it, the skin ripped from his mouth. (The refs stopped using their whistles after that and communicated by screaming for play to stop.) A fan in the stands died. This was not football. This was simply a bunch of men trying not to freeze to death. And yet the game is still talked about as a classic decades later, to the detriment not just of the men and women who play, but of the pleasure of the fans who watch them.\n\nWeather does not enhance the enjoyment of sports; it stands in the way. We watch sports to see a great quarterback throw a perfect pass to win the big game; we do not watch the ball hit a stiff wind and flutter like a wounded duck. Would anyone want to watch a basketball game where jump shots could be blown off course? What would that tell us about who was the better team?\n\nTo watch the Monfils-Djokovic match was to watch two men wilting and withering away; neither looked like even close to the star tennis players we\u2019ve seen them both be for years.

They carried signs and donned hats demanding a vote on legislation that would give immigrants brought to the U.S. as children a legal pathway to citizenship. The group has been at risk since the Trump Administration announced he was rescinding the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that shielded them from deportation.\n\nIn the halls of a Senate office building on Friday evening building, they unrolled a hand-painted sign that read: \u201cGOP, Don\u2019t hold the Dream Act Hostage.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are engaged in a game of chicken on Capitol Hill. Hours ahead of a shutdown, the Senate hit a stalemate on a short-term bill that would fund the government for the next month. The bill would ensure the lights stay on, fund a popular children\u2019s health care program for the next six years, and delay some Obamacare-related taxes. But the bill does not include protections for recipients of DACA. Because of that, immigrant rights activists said lawmakers should reject it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard some Democrats say that they support us, but we want to see them show that they support us with their votes and vote no on the spending bill without a Dream Act attached, \u201d said Sadaf Raza, 21, a student activist from Arkansas who joined a protest earlier on Friday.\n\nSaid Xiomara Caldera, 20, another student activist: \u201cFor any lawmaker who has voted on a spending bill without a Dream Act attached. I really just want to say to them, shame on you.\u201d\n\nWhile the continuing resolution passed with mostly Republican support in the House, its prospects are dimmer in the Senate. Given Republicans slim majority, it would need Democratic votes to pass. But because the bill lacks language on DACA and other Democratic priorities, many Democrats have said they cannot support it. If some vulnerable Democrats who are up for reelection in states that Trump won in 2016 are willing to cast votes for the measure, it would have a chance of passing before the midnight deadline.\n\nRegardless, Republicans have seized on Democratic opposition. Before the House even voted, they\u2019d begun placing the blame on Democrats who they say want to shutdown the government in order to protect illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cApparently they believe the issue of illegal immigration is more important than everything else,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a floor speech on Friday morning. \u201cAll of the essential services the American people depend on.\u201d McConnell called the Democrats\u2019 position as \u201ccompletely unfair and uncompassionate.\u201d\n\nBut for many grassroots activists, it\u2019s the complete opposite. \u201cI think it says a lot about the Republican Party that they\u2019re willing to pit children against immigrant youth when we know that both issues are important,\u201d says Alondra Gomez, 21, a DACA recipient and Tennessee college student who has been in Washington for the past week lobbying lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s just vile. It\u2019s cruel that they want to do this. We have to stand our ground.\u201d\n\nThe night before, she and other activists sat in the gallery of the U.S. Senate as Republican leaders insisted that lawmakers had until March to come up with a legislative solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that shielded some young immigrants from deportation. In reality, she said, the situation is much more dire. Her own DACA paperwork expires in September of this year and many of her friends have already lost their protections. And when Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, who has long supported legislation to give legal status to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. by their parents, implored his colleagues to consider the fate of an estimated 122 Dreamers who lose DACA protections everyday, Gomez cried.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, those Republicans had to see us. We\u2019ve been going to their offices and they kick us out. They don\u2019t hear our messages. They act as if they don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had to acknowledge that we\u2019re watching. That the whole country is watching.\u201d\n\nActivists reject the notion that the Democrats fight for immigrant protections puts beneficiaries of a child health insurance program at risk \u2014 there is appetite for both and lawmakers should be able to handle both, they say.\n\nFor their part, Democrats have said their opposition to the continuing resolution goes beyond the lack of protection for Dreamers. They are criticizing Republicans for failing to negotiate with them on a number of legislative priorities and said another short-term bill would not solve major funding issues. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Republican efforts to add funding for children\u2019s health insurance to the bill in order to drum up Democratic support is like trying to pass off a \u201cbowl of doggy doo with a cherry on top\u201d as a chocolate sundae.\n\nIf the government shuts down, there will be a rush to place the blame on one party over the other, but the young immigrants at the center of the push-and-pull say it is not fair to say their calls for a legislative fix to an issue that was manufactured by the Trump administration will be the reason any short-term CR fails.\n\n\u201cThis shut down is not an immigration shutdown,\u201d said Patrice Lawrence, the policy director for the UndocuBlack Network.\u201cThis comes down to Republicans not doing their job.\u201d", "title": "\u2018We Have to Stand Our Ground.\u2019 Activists Push Democrats to Fight for DACA Recipients in Shutdown", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5110974/government-shutdown-daca-activists/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T02:28:24Z"}, {"textData": "Turkey has complained for months about United States support for the Syrian Kurds.

(Bastien Inzaurralde,Jordan Frasier/The Washington Post)\n\nAs the federal government prepared to shut down late Friday, massive confusion spread throughout the bureaucracy as senior Trump administration officials painted radically different scenarios of whether basic governmental functions would continue or halt.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis said about half of the Pentagon\u2019s civilian employees would be sent home without pay, maintenance would cease and some intelligence operations overseas would stop. The Commerce Department sent talking points to managers, instructing them to tell furloughed employees to set up out-of-office voice-mail messages and take their office plants home. The Internal Revenue Service braced to lose more than half its workforce just as employees are answering questions about the new tax law.\n\nBut at the Environmental Protection Agency, Administrator Scott Pruitt told his roughly 15,000 employees to report to work Monday as if nothing would change, a direct contrast to the plan officials finalized last month suggesting that thousands of employees would be furloughed in the event of a shutdown. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to leave Monday for a trip that will take him to Europe for bilateral talks in Paris, London and Warsaw. His schedule includes a stop for the World Economic Forum at the swanky Swiss resort of Davos, where he is to meet up with President Trump.\n\n[Everything you need to know about a government shutdown]\n\nThe disconnect highlighted the clash between the White House\u2019s determination to keep the government as functional as possible and a vast workforce that typically scales back when its congressional appropriations expire.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters Friday evening, senior administration officials could not identify how many federal employees would be furloughed and how many agencies would be affected, referring questions to individual departments. Contingency plans drawn up in recent years called for high-percentage furloughs of civilian employees, including 78 percent of those at the Defense Department and 83 percent at Labor.\n\nAdministration officials acknowledged that many federal employees were not notified until Thursday or Friday that they could be affected, much later than would be typical. In 2013, more than 800,000 federal employees were sent home without pay for 16 days. The reason many weren\u2019t given more advance warning this time is because senior administration officials said they didn\u2019t realize the shutdown threat was real until days ago.\n\n[Last-ditch effort to avert a government shutdown]\n\nBudget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at the White House on Friday that a shutdown \u2014 the first under Republican control in Washington \u2014 \u201cwill look very different than it did under the previous administration,\u201d which he said deliberately exacerbated public impact.\n\nMulvaney said the administration was working to blunt a shutdown\u2019s effects by pushing agencies to use different accounts that might allow them more flexibility to pay employees, though it is unclear exactly how that would work. And it did not appear that the government\u2019s largest agencies, particularly the Defense Department, would be able to take advantage of such a tactic.\n\nPruitt told EPA employees late Friday that the agency could continue operating through all of next week even if spending expires. At the Interior Department, officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to keep things running, promising to keep open as many parks, national monuments and other public lands as possible \u2014 without visitors centers and with a skeleton staff of law enforcement.\n\nThe government will spend about $4.1 trillion this year, and roughly 30 percent of that is appropriated each year by Congress. About half of that money goes to the military, and the other half to dozens of federal agencies. When there is a shutdown \u2014 in this case a partial one, since lawmakers have passed a budget for the Veterans Health Administration \u2014 the government doesn\u2019t grind to a halt, but its operations are interrupted. Many employees deemed \u201cessential\u201d to the agency\u2019s day-to-day mission remain in their posts, often without pay, while others are sent home indefinitely.\n\nAgencies typically don\u2019t stockpile money to prepare for these types of lapses because they\u2019re not supposed to. Some officials said they could maintain operations by using carry-over funding, money that remains unspent and is either part of permanent or multiyear appropriations.\n\nIt was unclear how this strategy differed from the approach the Obama administration invoked in 2013, when Sylvia Mathews Burwell, then the director of the Office of Management and Budget, issued a Sept. 30 memo instructing heads of agencies that they could \u201ccontinue to operate under such previously approved apportionments\u201d from those buckets of funding.\n\nOMB officials wouldn\u2019t specify which agencies had access to this money or how it would work, though they said they place greater \u201cemphasis\u201d on using these funds compared to 2013. And as late as Friday night, the White House could not say which agencies would continue to operate either fully or partially.\n\nSam Berger, who served as OMB senior counselor and policy adviser during the 2013 shutdown, said this funding strategy helped Veterans Affairs and the State Department stay open during the 16-day budget impasse.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s sole focus was on making sure agencies complied with the law,\u201d Berger said. \u201cAnd agencies made determinations about the best way to utilize their funding consistent with the law, including the use of multiyear carry-over funding when appropriate.\u201d\n\nBut some budget experts questioned whether allowing agencies to pay employees with unused money or transfer money into salary accounts would be legal after the midnight deadline.\n\n\u201cWhat the administration is doing here is using an accounting trick to keep parts of the government open, and then it\u2019s not a shutdown at all,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former budget adviser to several Senate Republican leaders. \u201cI would question the legality of using those moneys when you have no authority at all to spend money.\u201d\n\nIf agencies were to stay open using the White House strategy, he added, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have budget lawyers working overtime and potentially with lawsuits.\u201d\n\nQuestions about this frenzy of activity \u2014 such as whether agency heads would need to move their money before midnight Friday \u2014 contributed to a sense of chaos as the Trump administration encountered its first bureaucratic fiasco. Trump and his deputies continued to attack Democrats on Capitol Hill even as they negotiated with them and downplayed the potential mess that could ensue.\n\nEmployees not scheduled to work over the weekend \u2014 the vast majority of the government \u2014 were told to come into work Monday morning to put things in order for an indefinite absence, leaving their government-issued cellphones and laptops at the office. No telework is allowed during a shutdown.\n\nThe next pay period for many employees runs through Jan. 26, and they will be paid for work through this past week.\n\nTony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers at more than 30 agencies, told reporters at 2 p.m. that \u201cour employees right now at this late hour are still waiting to get their notices.\u201d He said they worry that Congress will not ensure that they are paid after a shutdown ends, even though Congress has voted to pay them after previous shutdowns.\n\nAfter reporting Friday that more people sought care for flulike illnesses during the second week in January than at any comparable period in nearly a decade, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared to send more than 60 percent of its employees \u2014 about 8,500 people \u2014 home. CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben said the agency\u2019s \u201cimmediate response to urgent disease outbreaks, including seasonal influenza, would continue,\u201d through an analysis of data being reported to the government from state and local authorities and hospitals. But experts said the diminished staff levels could slow the rate of analysis.\n\nThe architects of the recently passed Republican tax law are relying on the tens of thousands of IRS employees to turn their new vision for the tax code into reality. But the agency was preparing to send home about 56 percent of its workforce, according to Treasury officials.\n\nA prolonged impasse could affect the pace at which IRS attorneys can issue new guidelines to resolve legal questions the law raises and to implement computer updates to IRS software for processing tax forms, tax experts said.\n\nA shutdown would halt key rail, airline and other investigations, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which said 95 percent of its more than 400 employees would be furloughed.\n\nAmong the work that would stop: Investigations into an Amtrak derailment near DuPont, Wash., in December that killed three people, and into a near miss at San Francisco International Airport in July, when an Air Canada flight nearly landed on the wrong runway, according to the NTSB.\n\nAt the State Department, consular offices abroad would continue to process visas, as long as the fees they generate pay for the cost. Ambassadors would continue meeting government officials around the world. Travel would be curtailed, but is allowed to proceed if the trips are for national security purposes, including negotiating treaties and attending bilateral meetings, or to save lives, as in the case of medical emergencies or providing refugees with food and medicine. Many training courses will be suspended, except for classes related to diplomatic security, anti-terrorism and preparing government employees to go to dangerous postings such as Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nFurloughed employees across the government will be advised to turn off their cellphones and have no email communications with colleagues who continue to work. They are prohibited from using social media accounts, and virtually all public speeches are forbidden. A skeletal team of public affairs spokesmen will be working to communicate with the media, but they are allowed to discuss only issues pertaining to national security.\n\nThe National Park Service issued a contingency plan Friday evening that outlined how access to public lands would be maintained to the greatest extent possible under a shutdown, even as buildings would be locked and visitor services would cease.\n\nAt Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida, some of the buildings could shut as soon as Saturday, though much of the park\u2019s 760,000 acres will remain open to visitors. The park is home to many large alligators and pythons, and there will not be as many park rangers working to enforce safety precautions.\n\n\u201cWe are going to put some information out that encourages people to use extra caution,\u201d spokeswoman Ardrianna McLane said.\n\nMichael Laris, Carol Morello, Brady Dennis, Lena Sun and Jeff Stein contributed to this report.", "title": "Massive confusion spreads through federal bureaucracy ahead of shutdown deadline - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/massive-confusion-spreads-through-federal-bureaucracy-ahead-of-shutdown-deadline/2018/01/19/c592d67a-fd60-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T01:57:58Z"}, {"textData": "If Congress fails to come to an agreement, the government shutdown that officially began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday would continue indefinitely.

Those whom the gods will mock, first they make pompous economic forecasters.\n\nIt\u2019s worth thinking carefully about why Trump\u2019s critics have been so wrong about the economy, and of the damage their hubris does to the anti-Trump case.\n\nDemocrats entered the 2016 election cycle on what they thought was the back of a strong economy. It wasn\u2019t. Barack Obama presided over the weakest expansion in postwar history. The economy grew by 15.5 percent from the second quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2016. During the (slightly longer) Reagan boom of 1982-90, it grew by more than 38 percent. The failure to understand this meant a failure to appreciate the depth of American discontent. It helps explain how Hillary Clinton lost her unlosable election to a man whose central claim to office was that he understood business.\n\nMore recently, Democrats have convinced themselves that Trump is merely the beneficiary of Obama\u2019s economic legacy. But how can the critics who previously assured us that Trump\u2019s election would cause certain calamity now explain that he\u2019s nothing but a lucky bystander to forces beyond his control? Had the economy tumbled over the past year his critics would surely have blamed him. It\u2019s ill grace to deny him all credit when it\u2019s doing so well.\n\nThe truth is that it\u2019s hard to account exactly for why the economy does well or poorly from one year to the next. But it\u2019s also true that the president has been nothing if not aggressive in his efforts to remove regulations, cut taxes and promote American business (not least his own), and animal spirits on Wall Street have responded accordingly.\n\nAlso true is that Americans will generally give credit for a good economy to whichever president presides over it. Yet one gets a distinct sense that Trump\u2019s relentless critics would rather bury the Apple news or look for the cloud within the silver lining. This is not a good look. If making confident but lousy predictions is one form of political malpractice, wanting things to fail is another.\n\nThe same goes for the looming government shutdown, which may have begun by the time you read this column. Democrats are placing a large bet that it\u2019s a political showdown they can win. But what they are mainly doing is wrecking their chances of retaking the House or Senate by appearing to put the interests of DACA\u2019s immigrant \u201cDreamers\u201d ahead of the rest of America.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow that helps Dreamers, Democrats, Americans or anyone other than the president and maybe California Senator Kamala Harris is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nDonald Trump is a profoundly defective person who nearly every morning does grave political self-harm with no assistance from his opponents. But he is also president, and normal Americans \u2014 that is, those who hold the outcome of the next election in their hands \u2014 do not want him to fail. They want statesmanship, not schadenfreude.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be smart of all of Trump\u2019s opponents to show they are superior to him in the former? And wouldn\u2019t a good way of doing that be to abjure the latter, even if it sometimes means giving him some credit?", "title": "Op-Ed Columnist: Clueless Versus Trump", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/opinion/clueless-versus-trump.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T01:44:29Z"}, {"textData": "Herbert Schmertz was born on March 22, 1930, in Yonkers. His father, Max, was a jeweler, and his mother, the former Hetty Frank, was a homemaker.\n\nMr. Schmertz grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y., and received a bachelor of arts degree from Union College, in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1952 and a bachelor of laws from Columbia University in 1955. (He added a doctor of laws degree from Union in 1977.)\n\nHe did intelligence work in the Army in Washington from 1955 to 1957, then worked for the American Arbitration Association before becoming an organizer for John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign in 1960.\n\nThat work led to a lifelong association with the Kennedy family and, once Robert F. Kennedy became his brother\u2019s attorney general, a job as general counsel to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.\n\nMr. Schmertz joined Mobil in 1966 as a labor lawyer, but took a leave two years later to work on Robert Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign; he would take another to work on Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign in 1979.\n\nHe took charge of Mobil\u2019s public affairs department in 1969 and filled that role almost continuously until leaving Mobil in 1988 to form his own company. For most of that stretch he had the title of vice president and played a significant role in shaping the company\u2019s policies.\n\nCritical of the news media, Mr. Schmertz advocated what he called creative confrontation \u2014 a markedly different approach from that of most companies, which tried to do their influencing behind the scenes.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFor a long time, business and business leaders didn\u2019t feel it was part of their responsibility\u201d to make their voices and opinions heard, he told United Press International in 1986. They believed, he continued, \u201cthat if they ignored unfair criticism it would go away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added, \u201cI believe you should meet it head on and deal with it.\u201d\n\nTo do just that, in October 1970, Mr. Schmertz began buying space on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times to express the company\u2019s views in essay form. Sometimes the essays responded to the news of the moment; other times they addressed broader issues, like mass transit. They advertorials appeared in other newspapers as well, and Mr. Schmertz made scores of television appearances.\n\nHis methods and visibility brought him all sorts of labels \u2014 \u201cMobil\u2019s superflack,\u201d \u201cthe Billy Martin of corporate P.R.\u201d and, as the headline on a New York magazine profile of him put it, \u201cOil Slick.\u201d\n\nPolitically, Mr. Schmertz was hard to pin down; in addition to working on the Kennedys\u2019 campaigns, he helped Bob Dole, the Republican senator from Kansas, in his 1988 presidential run. Mr. Schmertz often said that his public-relations philosophy was nothing more than applying the sharp-elbowed lessons of politics to the business world.\n\nHe once pulled Mobil advertising from The Wall Street Journal in a dispute over coverage. In 1986 he laid down his ideas and war stories in a book, \u201cGoodbye to the Low Profile: The Art of Creative Confrontation,\u201d written with William Novak.\n\nYet many in the public-relations business thought his blustery approach did as much harm as good.\n\n\u201cTo go out and argue with people in public, it\u2019s like seeing two people fighting in the street,\u201d Richard Cheney, another public relations executive, told The Washington Post in 1988. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to take sides, you just want them to stop.\u201d\n\nThe less flashy pillar of Mr. Schmertz\u2019s philosophy was what he called \u201caffinity of purpose\u201d \u2014 getting policymakers and the public to have a presumptive good opinion of your company by associating it with high-minded things like \u201cMasterpiece Theater\u201d (now known simply as \u201cMasterpiece\u201d). Countless viewers heard the phrase \u201cmade possible by a grant from Mobil\u201d as they tuned in \u201cThe First Churchills,\u201d \u201cI, Claudius\u201d and other British productions presented by \u201cMasterpiece,\u201d an anthology series produced by WGBH in Boston.\n\nBecause of its support from Mobil and other oil companies, PBS was sometimes called the Petroleum Broadcasting Service in those early years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cCultural excellence generally suggests corporate excellence,\u201d Mr. Schmertz told New York magazine, explaining the millions of dollars Mobil put into arts ventures.\n\nAmong his clients after he formed his own company was the World Bank, which hired him in 1994 to try to improve its image.\n\nMr. Schmertz and his first wife, the former Ida Schaap, were divorced in 1976. His second marriage, to the former Susan Burley, ended in divorce in 1993. In addition to his daughter Nicole, Mr. Schmertz, who lived in West Palm Beach, is survived by another daughter, Lexy Schmertz; his sons, Anthony, Thomas and Conor; and six grandchildren. His brother, Eric, a noted labor mediator, died in 2010.\n\nAlthough few public-relations specialists today would take as abrasive a tack as Mr. Schmertz sometimes did, the modern media landscape is full of advertiser-influenced or controlled content that calls to mind his early forays into advertorials. On his retirement from Mobil in 1988, he was asked to name his greatest achievement.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d he told The Times, \u201cthat Mobil has made it respectable for companies to have views, opinions and philosophies and to express them.\u201d", "title": "Herbert Schmertz, 87, Innovative Public-Relations Man, Dies at 87", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/obituaries/herbert-schmertz-87-innovative-public-relations-man-dies-at-87.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T01:44:28Z"}, {"textData": "With the Senior Bowl on the horizon and the scouting combine just around the next corner, the mock draft machine is starting to churn out projections from every corner of the major media outlets.\n\nThe latest 2018 NFL mock draft comes from NFL Network\u2019s Daniel Jeremiah, who has two quarterback-needy teams passing on some of this year\u2019s top signal-callers in the top five.\n\nAt No. 2 overall, Jeremiah has the New York Giants opting to help Eli Manning rather than replace him, grabbing Penn State running back Saquon Barkley.

A group that tracks Russian-linked social media influence campaigns says the volume of Russian-related #ReleaseTheMemo traffic represents the most coordinated such effort since their website launched in early August.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any single hashtag that has had this amount of activity behind it,\u201d said Bret Schafer, an analyst who helps runs the Hamilton 68 dashboard , a project with the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund. It tracks about 600 accounts that it says are tied to Russian-sponsored influence and disinformation campaigns; most of those accounts were promoting the same meme Friday.\n\nWHAT IS THE MEMO?\n\nThe underlying #ReleaseTheMemo drama started Thursday after Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, revealed a brief report produced by Republican staff dealing with Trump\u2019s wiretapping allegations. The report stems from a lengthy investigation House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes conducted into the alleged surveillance of Trump transition aides and the revealing of names \u2014 or \u201cunmasking\u201d \u2014 of Trump aides in classified reports.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted on party lines \u2014 over Democratic member objections \u2014 early Thursday to make the brief, 3-page report available to members of Congress. But the same Republican members have said they cannot say what exactly what the report shows because it is classified \u2014 and revealing classified information is a federal crime.\n\nCommittee officials who reviewed the documents said that they revolve around a dossier on Trump produced by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and questions over whether it was used to obtain surveillance warrants. The report also relies on classified intelligence that is only available to a select group of lawmakers known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2014 a sign that some of the information is highly sensitive.\n\nThroughout the day Thursday and Friday, lawmakers walked in and out of a classified room in the Capitol to review the report \u2014 but never leaving with a copy because of the sensitive contents.\n\nWHERE DID THE MEME COME FROM?\n\nAs with previous spikes of coordinated activity tracked by the Hamilton 68 group \u2014 such as one surrounding the national anthem protest controversy at NFL games \u2014 it\u2019s hard to trace back to how it started, and how much the Russian-linked network might simply be mimicking a U.S. trend.\n\n\u201cMy guess is this started organically,\u201d Schafer said. The website WikiLeaks was an early big promoter of #ReleaseTheMemo, and it received attention Thursday night from conservative personalities including the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., and Republican U.S. Rep. Steve King. It\u2019s possible that the Russian-affiliated accounts simple \u201chopped on it, promoted it, amplified it,\u201d Schafer said.\n\nOn Friday, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange blasted Hamilton 68 \u2014 where else? \u2014 on Twitter, calling its work \u201cpropaganda\u201d and its methodology \u201cunfalsifiable\u201d and \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\nVEIL OF SECRECY\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said Friday that lawmakers had to sign a waiver produced by the House Intelligence Committee that barred them from obtaining copies of the report, taking notes about the report or discussing anything they read in the report. Krishnamoorthi said he did not know what the penalty was if anyone violated that waiver.\n\nHouse Russia investigation chairman Michael Conaway, a Texas Republican, said the intelligence committee could make this report available to the public directly. If the committee votes to \u201coverride\u201d the classification of the material in the report, it would then move to the president, who would have five days to decide whether the classified material poses a national security risk. The full House could vote to override the president if he opted to keep the material secret.\n\nConaway said late Friday that he would like to make this report public, but declined to say if the intelligence committee would exercise its classification override powers.\n\nANOTHER TWITTER CLAMPDOWN\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter said in a blog post Friday that it would email nearly 678,000 people in the U.S. to notify them they had followed accounts linked to Russian propagandists or had retweeted or liked a tweet sent out by them around the 2016 election.\n\nIt also said it had found 1,062 new accounts associated with the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency. That brings the total to 3,814; Twitter has suspended those accounts.\n\nTwitter also identified another 13,500 automated accounts \u2014 for a total of 50,258 \u2014 that were linked to Russia and tweeting out election-related material. \u201cAny such activity represents a challenge to democratic societies everywhere, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to work on this important issue,\u201d the company said.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, the U.S. Senator from Virginia who\u2019s harshly criticized Twitter\u2019s lackluster investigation into Russian meddling, tweeted Friday that he was \u201cencouraged to see the company beginning to take responsibility\u201d in dealing with the issue.\n\n___\n\nO\u2019Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

In September, a deal-making dinner with \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d \u2014 Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader \u2014 later devolved into angry recriminations.

Mr. Schumer told the president, the person said, that Democrats would oppose a three-week measure because they saw it as a delaying tactic.\n\nA White House official said that Mr. Schumer raised the possibility of a one- or two-day extension, but Mr. Trump told Mr. Schumer to work out the details of a short-term measure with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.\n\nA short time later, Mr. Schumer called the president, the person said, but the conversation drove the pair even further apart. The immigration concessions from Democrats were not conservative enough, Mr. Trump told Mr. Schumer. The president said he needed more border security measures as well as more enforcement of illegal immigration in parts of the country far from the border.\n\nAs the evening wore on, Mr. Schumer got a call from Mr. Kelly that dashed all hopes for a Trump-Schumer deal before the shutdown deadline of midnight. Mr. Kelly, a hard-liner on immigration, the person familiar with the call said, outlined a long list of White House objections to the deal.\n\nA White House official familiar with the call said Mr. Kelly urged Mr. Schumer to work out the details of an agreement with Mr. McConnell.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a Twitter post at 9:28 p.m., Mr. Trump vented his pessimism on Twitter, returning to his administration\u2019s efforts to try to make sure that Democrats receive the blame from voters angry about a government shutdown exactly one year from his inauguration.\n\n\u201cNot looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cDems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.\u201d\n\nWith talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer over, Republicans in the Senate scheduled a vote on a House-passed measure that leaders in both parties expected to fail.

Mr. Schumer told attendees that the Democrats had stymied their chances with a message that failed to track more closely with Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for fair trade.\n\nAfter the failed negotiations on Capitol Hill and at the White House, Democrats predicted that the public would blame Mr. Trump and his Republican allies for a government shutdown, citing past examples of political stalemates in which voters punished Republican presidents and lawmakers.\n\nThroughout the day, Mr. Trump told aides that he knows he is going to get blamed for the shutdown, regardless of what happens and how it goes down.\n\nBut at the White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides maneuvered to try to shield the president from the political damage that could follow.

The couple had been married civilly in 2010, however, they said they couldn\u2019t follow-up with a church ceremony because of the 2010 earthquake that hit Chile. (L\u2019Osservatore Romano Vatican Media/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLIMA, Peru \u2014 The honeymoon, as it were, is apparently over.\n\nA day after Pope Francis grabbed headlines by pronouncing two flight attendants man and wife while flying 36,000 feet over Chile, the conservative Catholic commentariat on Friday questioned the legitimacy of the impromptu sacrament and warned it could cheapen the church\u2019s marriage preparation down the line.\n\n\u201cDo you know what\u2019s a \u2018marriage\u2019 ripe for annulment?\u201d tweeted the traditionalist blog Rorate Caeli. \u201cOne celebrated apparently on a whim in an airplane whose celebrant cannot even be sure if parties are validly baptized.\u201d\n\nFor those who missed the news, Francis on Thursday presided over what the Vatican said was the doctrinally and canonically legitimate wedding of Paula Podest and Carlos Ciuffardi, two flight attendants from LATAM flight 1250 that brought the pope, his delegation and travelling press from Santiago to the northern city of Iquique.\n\nAs the happy couple told journalists after the fact \u2014 and after serving breakfast \u2014 they had hoped to just get a blessing from the pope. They told him that they had been married civilly in 2010, but that their plans for a church wedding fell through when an earthquake hit.\n\nAs Ciuffardi told it, the pope proposed that he marry the couple right there, in part to motivate other couples to contract a church wedding at a time when more and more couples are merely cohabitating.\n\n\u201cHe told me it\u2019s historic, that there has never before been a pope who married someone aboard a plane,\u201d Ciuffardi told reporters from the back galley.\n\nThe surreal scene had the effect \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 of giving Francis a bit of a reprieve after his visit to Chile was dominated by a church sex abuse scandal.\n\nCanon lawyer Ed Peters, a consultor on the Vatican high court but a frequent critic of Francis, questioned whether a host of church laws were followed, including the requirement that the couple undergo pastoral counseling and that the church have evidence that there were no obstacles to the marriage.\n\nIn a follow-up blog post Friday, Peters noted a Chilean media report from December saying the couple was hoping for an airborne wedding presided over by Francis, suggesting the portrayal of the surprise ceremony was anything but. Ciuffardi said Chilean reporters had suggested it before the fact, but he insisted he and Podest were only looking for a papal blessing, and that nothing was confirmed until they were airborne.\n\nConservative blogger Phil Lawler mused that priests might now have a harder time trying to properly prepare Catholic couples for marriage now that Francis had set the papal precedent of completing the process between takeoff and landing.\n\n\u201cDoes he ask them to reflect seriously on their commitment? Nope,\u201d Lawler wrote at Catholic Culture. \u201cDoes he question them about their years of cohabitation? Evidently not. Does he hear their confessions? Not likely. Plan a dignified ceremony? Not at all.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the naysayers all hail from the Anglo-Saxon blogosphere, which is among the most vocal in criticizing Francis, especially on issues of marriage.\n\nFrancis has split the church over his cautious opening to allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Communion, so any issue related to marriage is particularly sensitive.\n\nAt The Tablet, a more liberal leaning British weekly, Vatican correspondent Christopher Lamb suggested that the airborne nuptials were part of the \u201cparadigm shift\u201d that Francis is trying to press in the church.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the pope is doing away with the need for rules, for canon law or for paperwork, but rather ensuring it is correctly prioritized,\u201d Lamb wrote. \u201cFor the pope, these things must support the spread of the Gospel, and not become like the thorns that grow up and strangle the seeds in the parable of the sower.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Despite frigid temperatures, there was no indication of bad weather that night.\n\nAuthorities eventually found the wreckage engulfed in flames, which had sparked a grass fire.\n\nColfax County Sheriff Rick Sinclair told The Associated Press that he helped search the rugged terrain and that when crews found the wreckage, residents from nearby ranches were working to extinguish the blaze.\n\nTwo victims were found in the helicopter, and a third was found several feet away, he said.\n\nBennett and Dodd were alive but in critical condition when authorities arrived. One of them was so injured that he rolled some 150 feet (46 meters) to get away from the flames, Sinclair said. The other appeared to have walked an equal distance before collapsing.\n\n\u201cThe will to survive from the guy that rolled is incredible because he was smashed up,\u201d Sinclair said.\n\nState police say one of the men died at the scene a short time later and the other died en route to the hospital.\n\nDodd said on his call that he had a broken pelvis and was trying to move away from the blaze. Andra Cobb also told a 911 operator that Dodd was \u201crolling away from the fire the best he can.\u201d\n\nShe said the helicopter had been in the air for just three to five minutes after taking off from the airport in the small community of Raton. In the call, she can be heard weeping and telling Bennett to breathe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very cold,\u201d she tells the operator.\n\n___\n\nHudetz reported from Albuquerque.

I no longer hold out hope there is an innocent explanation for the information the public has seen.\u201d\n\nBut Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, denounced the report as \u201ca profoundly misleading set of talking points\u201d that were \u201crife with factual inaccuracies\u201d and created \u201ca distorted view of the F.B.I.\u201d He said the memo\u2019s boosters were carrying water for the White House.\n\nSeveral people familiar with the memo said it contained several pages of bullet points focusing on material drawn from the application materials for a FISA warrant targeting Carter Page, a onetime campaign adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Page, who had visited Moscow in July 2016 and left the campaign that September, a month before the application, was suspected of acting as a foreign agent for the Russian government. He has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAlthough the application is said to have drawn on a variety of material, the Intelligence Committee memo apparently focuses on one strand: information from Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence agent who wrote the dossier of unverified and salacious allegations that suggested that Mr. Trump had been compromised by a Russian intelligence operation.\n\nMr. Steele had been retained to investigate Mr. Trump by Fusion GPS, a research firm that had been hired by a law firm working for Democrats. When Mr. Steele decided to take the information he was gathering to the F.B.I. in August and October 2016, according to people familiar with those conversations, he told the bureau\u2019s agents that he was working for interests opposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Fusion GPS, which was under contract with the Democrats at the time, paid around $160,000 for Mr. Steele\u2019s research.\n\nIt is not clear how much of that context \u2014 if any \u2014 law enforcement officials conveyed to the court.\n\nTwo people familiar with the warrant application said law enforcement officials described Mr. Steele not as a Democratic-funded investigator, but as a reliable F.B.I. source who had previously provided information about corruption in FIFA, the global governing body for soccer.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor who specializes in national security issues, said that disclosing Mr. Steele\u2019s backers could affect a judge\u2019s assessment of his credibility. But Mr. Vladeck cautioned that without seeing the warrant application, it was impossible to say whether that information was just \u201cbackground noise\u201d or pivotal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is a world of difference between an application that relied solely on this information and an application that relied on this and 22 pieces of independently corroborated information,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a transcript of a congressional interview made public on Thursday, Glenn R. Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, told the House Intelligence Committee that Mr. Steele decided on his own to go to the F.B.I. and that neither of them had asked permission from their client, nor received instructions from their client to do so.\n\nRepublicans have been suggesting for weeks that the Russia investigation traces back to a conspiracy by top F.B.I. officials to sabotage Mr. Trump. They have noted that two officials who were involved in the Russia investigation \u2014 Peter Strzok, who led the F.B.I. counterespionage section in 2016, and Lisa Page, an F.B.I. lawyer \u2014 exchanged texts indicating that they disliked Mr. Trump and wanted him to lose the election.\n\nA senior Democratic staff member on the House Intelligence Committee said the memo drew on classified documents that have been shown only to Representative Devin Nunes, Mr. Schiff and four staff members. \u201cIt\u2019s like they put out a book review of a book they never read,\u201d said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, who serves on the committee.\n\nSeeded throughout the memo, Democrats said, were characterizations of law enforcement officials as nefariously biased in favor of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Swalwell said he feared it would cause lasting damage to the F.B.I.\u2019s reputation, adding, \u201cIt is clear to me that they are just trying to put a cloud over Mueller,\u201d referring to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.\n\nMr. Nunes has previously advanced alarming claims about the Russia investigation and surveillance in support of Mr. Trump. Last spring, he said he planned to share information with the White House showing that Mr. Trump\u2019s associates had been picked up in surveillance and that Obama administration officials had improperly \u201cunmasked\u201d their identities in intelligence reports.\n\nIt later emerged that Mr. Nunes had received the information he saw from the White House itself, and other Republicans who viewed the material concluded that there had not been any improper unmasking.\n\nIn a speech on the House floor on Thursday night, Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, blamed the Steele dossier for creating a false Russian narrative. He said that Mr. Nunes had been working to get the truth and that he was \u201cshocked to read exactly what has taken place.\u201d\n\nConservative news media like the Fox News evening shows pounced after reports of the memo\u2019s existence emerged Thursday, with personalities like Sean Hannity declaring that what he had been told about the memo showed that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump-Russia affair should be disbanded.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Twitter account for WikiLeaks offered to pay anyone who would leak the memo, using a hashtag \u2014 #releasethememo \u2014 that by Friday morning had been invoked and amplified thousands of times in posts by other Twitter accounts that are deemed by a German Marshall Fund tracking project to be part of Russian-linked influence networks.", "title": "Republicans Claim Surveillance Power Abuses in Russia Inquiry - New York Times", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/us/politics/republicans-surveillance-trump-russia-inquiry.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T01:16:47Z"}, {"textData": "If voters had forgotten the shutdown months later in 2013, they may forget it even more quickly in 2018. In the dizzying news cycle of the Trump era, voters can hardly remember what happened a few days ago.\n\nMr. Trump is not just historically unpopular; he is also central to voter perceptions of the Republican Party \u2014 a lesson Republicans ruefully learned in the electoral wipeouts they suffered in Virginia and New Jersey last November.\n\nAn NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released Friday found that 38 percent of voters said they wanted to send a message of opposition to Mr. Trump with their midterm vote, the highest figure making such a statement since Democrats reclaimed both chambers of Congress in 2006.\n\nThe shutdown of 2013 and another in 1995 featured a deft Democratic politician in the White House who skillfully directed voter anger to the Republicans in Congress. President Bill Clinton was able to blame Newt Gingrich, the House speaker at the time, even after he vetoed spending bills that would have kept the government open.\n\nThis time around, Democrats in Congress are confident that they can rely on Mr. Trump\u2019s inevitable outbursts to motivate their base and win over moderates. That confidence has emboldened Democrats to engage in some brinkmanship that they may have steered away from with a less bombastic figure in the White House.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe president is going to figure in almost every voter\u2019s mind in the midterms,\u201d said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, adding: \u201cDemocrats have learned that it\u2019s not in our interest and it\u2019s not consistent with our values to constantly get rolled.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNor is it so politically daring when they are facing an opposition that spent much of Thursday deploying an alliterative hashtag, #schumershutdown, to try to pin the blame for a shutdown on Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, only to see Mr. Trump summon the would-be boogeyman to a White House meeting on Friday without any Republican lawmakers present.\n\nCongressional Republicans could only chuckle about the uncertain staying power of their newly hatched slogan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the recycling life on a hashtag is,\u201d said Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas.\n\nMr. Trump did not wind up devising an agreement of his own with Mr. Schumer during their 90-minute one-on-one in the West Wing. But the president\u2019s unilateral decision to enter into his own negotiation was a reminder to Republicans that their president is effectively a political free agent who acts more on whim, and with an eye toward media coverage, than any fixed worldview.\n\nAsked if he was alarmed about Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. Schumer alone, Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri was succinct: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThis is not to say that Senate Democrats, particularly those running this fall in the heavily white states that Mr. Trump swept in 2016, do not face any risk in a shutdown, especially if it is seen as revolving largely around protecting the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.\n\nPolling done by a Democratic \u201csuper PAC,\u201d the Senate Majority PAC, revealed that in Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia, voters would fault Democrats if DACA, the program shielding the young immigrants from deportation, is what prompted the crisis.\n\nSenate Democrats are up for re-election in each of the five states, and if the party does not hold nearly all of the seats, it has no chance to net the two seats necessary to claim the majority.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve kind of gotten out over their skis,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican, said of Democrats. \u201cEverybody realizes this is all about immigration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd Republicans were heartened by a CNN survey released Friday showing that far more Americans believe it is more important to avoid a government shutdown than continue DACA.\n\nYet every poll indicates that voters would blame Republicans if Congress does not keep the government open, and veteran party officials concede that they would face a communications challenge in making the case that they were not responsible for a shutdown.\n\nAre You a Federal Worker Who Would Be Affected by the Looming Shutdown?

And few know more than Mr. Gingrich about how difficult it is to remain steadfast on a shutdown strategy when party unity breaks down.\n\nIf Mr. Trump and Senate leaders hammer out an agreement that offers legal status to the Dreamers but is not perceived as sufficiently tough on other immigration and border security measures, it may cause heartburn among conservative lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the House rank and file, you get very nervous,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cYou begin to think: \u2018Do I have to vote against this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats, shut out of power in Congress but handed the political gift of Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity and unpredictability, could only look on in delight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as frustrating to his own party, quite frankly,\u201d said Representative Joseph Crowley of New York.", "title": "News Analysis: Shutdown?
