In addition to filling in for his father at a high-dollar fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach, Fla., the 34-year old also went on Fox News Channel's \"Judge Jeanine,\" to defend the president's accomplishments.\n\nBetween accolades for his father, the younger Trump stumbled over a basic rule of politics: Never boast about how you will benefit politically from the misfortune of your constituents.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing for us,\" Eric Trump said of the government shutdown that was triggered at midnight on Friday by the failure of congressional negotiators and the Trump White House to reach a deal to fund the government. The public, Eric Trump said, would blame Democrats for the paralysis in Washington, and for the forced furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal employees, who would be sent home without pay.\n\nYet even if this prediction came true \u2013 and recent polling suggests otherwise \u2013 it could be seen as a stumble at a politically fraught time for his father and Republican lawmakers.\n\nTo be sure, Eric Trump is not the sort of experienced politician who might be expected to navigate situations like these with traditional savvy. But neither is he the disinterested outsider that he promised to be in late 2016, as his father prepared to take office.\n\nIn March 2017, weeks after the elder Trump's inauguration, Eric Trump was still describing a \"clear separation of church and state\" between his father's political career and the Trump Organization, the family real estate business that he and his brother Donald Trump Jr. are managing while their father is president. Yet almost from the start, both Eric and Donald Jr. have served as outspoken political advocates for the president and his policies.\n\nSaturday offered a perfect example of this ongoing tension. By calling in to Jeanine Pirro's show a little after 9 p.m. ET, Eric Trump was serving as a both a de facto White House surrogate on prime-time TV and as a stand-in for his father at a gala fundraiser for Trump's reelection campaign.\n\nWhether Eric Trump's boast will turn into a headache for the Trump White House remains to be seen. And it wasn't the only miscalculation he made on Saturday night.\n\nDuring Saturday's call-in with Pirro, Eric Trump sought to explain why Democrats deserve the blame for the current shutdown by highlighting how many Democrats voted against a bill to fund the government.\n\n\"If you looked at the vote, you had 269 Republicans who voted to keep the government open. And you had 230 Democrats who voted to close government,\" he said, \"and they'll say Trump wanted to close the government. ... It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And I'm pretty good at math.\"\n\nYet in the House, 230 Republicans voted for the measure, while in the Senate, 45 did, for a total of 275 GOP votes \u2013 not 269, as Trump claimed. On the Democrats' side, 197 voted against the spending bill in the House, while 44 Democrats opposed advancing the measure in the Senate for a total of 241 \u2013 not 230.\n\nThe White House referred CNBC's questions to Eric Trump, but attempts to reach him late Saturday were unsuccessful.", "title": "Eric Trump says the shutdown is 'a good thing for us,\u2019 politically", "sourceId": "cnbc", "sourceName": "CNBC", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/21/eric-trump-the-shutdown-is-a-good-thing-for-us-politically.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T06:00:00Z"}, {"textData": "Ostia, Italy - Activist Diego Gianelli says he has been attacked by fascists six times.\n\nOn a wintry day in early January, the 27-year old escapes the piercing wind and ducks into a time-worn bar outside a train station in Ostia, the poverty-hit coastal suburb of Rome where he lives.\n\nRemoving his jacket, he quickly orders a coffee and stands at the bar.\n\nA charismatic man with a patchy beard, Gianelli speaks with jubilance despite running through a laundry list of violence he attributes to CasaPound.\n\nThe self-proclaimed fascist party made landmark inroads in municipal elections in November when it obtained nine percent of the overall vote and hopes to make gains in Italy's upcoming national elections in March.\n\nParty supporters have slashed Gianelli's tyres five times, bashed his car windows four times and tagged graffiti on his car and apartment building.\n\nCasaPound denies such allegations, but Gianelli is one of several local anti-fascist activists and critics who have accused the group of violence.\n\nHe shakes his head as he recalls one of the most egregious assaults, which took place in February.\n\nOn that day, Gianelli was \"running late as usual\" rushing to a city council meeting, he says, when he spotted CasaPound members posted next to the entrance.\n\nKnown in Ostia for his outspoken anti-fascism, he opted to enter the building from the rear entrance rather than risk confrontation.\n\nBut he hadn't gone unnoticed. When a guard informed said he could only enter using the main entrance, he decided to make his way home.\n\nHowever, a gang of five CasaPound supporters was waiting at his car.\n\nRecognising one of the young men as a former classmate, Gianelli asked what they were doing at his car.\n\n\"Then he hit me, and I fell,\" he says.\n\nWithin seconds of hitting the pavement, kicks and punches thudded against Gianelli's sides as he put his hands up to protect his head.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nHis attackers left him on the ground with his lips busted, a mouth full of blood and three broken ribs.\n\n\"Go tell the police now,\" they said, mocking him.\n\nBorn as a political movement in 2003, when far-rightists occupied a vacant municipal building in central Rome, CasaPound's name is an ode to the American poet Ezra Pound, who was a supporter of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini.\n\n'A controlled form of neo-fascism'\n\nIn November, CasaPound clenched around 6,000 votes of the vote in Ostia's municipal elections - a nearly 600 percent increase from the previous vote a few years earlier.\n\nIts newfound success in Ostia came on the heels of the party securing eight percent of the votes in Lucca's mayoral elections in June and recently landing its members on city councils in nearby Todi and the northern city of Bolzano.\n\nWith CasaPound's Luca Marsella, a vocal fascist who has been accused of violent threats, now a district councilor in Ostia, the elections have prompted fear among political opponents and analysts who worry about the return of fascism in a country that toiled for 21 years under Mussolini's rule.\n\nGuido Caldiron, a Rome-based journalist and author of Extreme Right, a book that examines the growth of the far right in Europe and elsewhere, says the electoral results in Ostia are \"very important because Rome is CasaPound's core. For them, it's a very significant victory\".\n\nDescribing a \"militarised entity\" whose supporters simultaneously carry out attacks while the party's brass denies any affiliation with bloodshed, Caldiron tells Al Jazeera: \"Even when they are involved in violence, they always try to cover it.\"\n\nThe efforts at protecting its brand and presenting a respectable face to the public, Caldiron argues, distinguishes CasaPound from other far-right groups that openly celebrate violence against anti-fascists and migrants.\n\n\"They have people who are legitimate criminals, and they have to control that - it's a controlled form of neo-fascism,\" he explains.\n\n\"You can be violent, but you have to accept certain rules and not show off about your violence \u2026 It is all part of a package designed to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of respectability.\"\n\nDeadly and dangerous attacks\n\nDespite regularly denying violence, CasaPound's members and supporters have a lengthy history of attacks.\n\nIn December 2011, a 50-year-old CasaPound supporter in Florence shot dead two Senegalese street traders and injured three others before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide.\n\nCasaPound activist Alberto Palladino has been sentenced to two years in prison over an attack that hospitalised five activists from the centre-left Democratic Party that same year. The party claims that he was wrongfully convicted.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nMore recently, as locals in Ostia geared up to cast their ballots in November, local mob affiliate Roberto Spada head-butted and struck with a pipe reporter Daniele Piervincenzi when the journalist asked about his support for CasaPound.\n\nSpada had previously proclaimed in a Facebook post.\n\nThe incident was caught on tape and led to national outcry.\n\nCasaPound subsequently attempted to distance itself from the Spada Clan, a local mafia network active in Ostia.\n\n'If there were no anti-fascists, there'd be no violence'\n\nOn a chilly morning in early January, a self-described \"militant\" opens the door of CasaPound's squat in central Rome. Inside, he points to the walls of the corridor, which are colourfully painted with the names of the party's heroes.\n\nMussolini and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whose work was glorified by both Italian and German fascists, are honoured.\n\nLess explicable are names such as Ahmad Shah Massoud, the late Afghan militia leader who battled the Soviets and the Taliban alike, and Jack Kerouac, the American novelist and pioneer of the Beat Generation literary movement.\n\nSimone Di Stefano, CasaPound's prime ministerial candidate in the upcoming national elections in March, insists that the party's gains in Ostia are important in an area \"that has been abandoned by the state\" that has been unfairly branded as a \"mafia city\".\n\nSwaddled in a black winter coat, Di Stefano runs his hand through his short, grey-peppered hair. He sits in a conference room.\n\nThe walls are blanketed in party propaganda announcing conferences and celebrating visits by far-right parties from across the Europe.\n\nOne of the posters announces a 2014 meeting between CasaPound and party officials from the Golden Dawn, the neo-fascist party in nearby Greece.\n\nOn an adjacent wall, a framed CasaPound poster brandishes the face of Julius Evola, the Italian philosopher whose work sought to advance fascism.\n\nSince its establishment 14 years ago, CasaPound has opened 106 offices across the country and boasts of 20,000 card-carrying members.\n\nIn recent years, the party broadened its base with increasing success by taking aim at refugees and migrants, capitalising on Euroscepticism and squatting buildings to protest Italy's housing crisis.\n\nWhile leftists and anarchists have for decades occupied buildings for people displaced by evictions and carried out social projects such as distributing food to the poor, CasaPound's cooptation of these tactics come with an important distinction: Italians only.\n\nDi Stefano does not deny its supporters participate in physical confrontation.\n\n\"If there were no anti-fascists, there would be no violence,\" he says.\n\nHe points to an incident in January 2017, when a police officer was injured while attempting to defuse an explosive device outside a CasaPound-linked bookshop in Florence.\n\nReferring to Gianelli, the anti-fascist who claims to have been attacked, he says the accusations are \"lies\", adding that CasaPound has attempted to sue the activist for libel in the past.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nDi Stefano blames the media and anti-fascists for violence, dubbing them as agents of \"globalism\", a term that critics say carries anti-Semitic undertones.\n\n\"There is no actual evidence [of CasaPound] doing physical attacks,\" he claims.\n\nA priest and teenager resolve to fight on\n\nBack in Ostia, local leaders and residents dismiss claims of CasaPound's innocence.\n\nWitnessing the party's rise around him, Franco De Donno, a priest who has lived in the suburb since 1981, decided last Autumn to run in the municipal elections. Now a district councilor, he sits across the table from the fascist party's Marsella in municipal meetings.\n\nExplaining that he was born on June 2, 1946, the day that Italy became a republic, De Donno says: \"Being democratic and anti-fascist is in my DNA.\"\n\nSitting in a cafe on Ostia's main square, De Donno recounts leaving the church after a sermon to find a band of CasaPound members holding up a banner accusing him of being a traitor for his open support of refugees and migrants.\n\nThe priest has helped form a network of solidarity activists and like-minded members of the faith community.\n\n\"If this mentality of exclusion [of migrants and others] continues, there will be no peace and no development,\" he argues, \"but the strongest enemy that needs to be defeated is indifference [to fascism].\"\n\nCarlo*, a 16-year-old Ostia local, smokes a cigarette and drinks espresso at a cafe.\n\nYoung people, he says, should get involved in the anti-fascist movement early on.\n\nHe has been twice assaulted by CasaPound supporters.\n\nDuring the summer of 2017, a CasaPound supporter - an adult male - asked if he had been present in anti-fascist demonstrations in front of the party's offices.\n\n\"What?\" he replied, surprised by the question.\n\nThen a fist crashed into his eye. \"What the f*ck? I didn't do anything,\" Carlo said.\n\nHe decided not to press charges because he did not trust the police department.\n\n\"Then other people started threatening me,\" he explains. \"They said, 'We'll shoot you.'\"\n\nFrom that day on, when CasaPound supporters saw him in the street, they hurled insults and threats in his direction. \"They called me a 'shitty hippie' and a 'communist f*ggot.'.\"\n\nA few months later, when Carlo and his girlfriend were at a pub, a group of seven CasaPound supporters - all adults - called him over to their table. \"What do you think about fascism?\" one of them men asked him.\n\nFearing another attack, Carlo replied simply: \"It's an important part of our country's history.\"\n\nHe remembers: \"I wanted to say, 'Fascism is sh*tty,' but I couldn't.\"\n\nAfter a brief exchange, the man grabbed Carlo by the collar, pulled him close and threatened him. When Carlo broke free, a fist was thrown in his direction and narrowly missed his face.\n\nOne of the men yelled at him and his girlfriend: \"You deserve to have c*cks on your face.\"\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nWorried by the prospect of more violence, Carlo has changed his daily routine, avoiding CasaPound's office and hangouts frequented by the party's supporters.\n\nBut he insists that he will continue to protest.\n\n\"I'm not scared. Everyone fears being beaten up; but I can get over that because I believe in the [anti-fascist] cause and have my ideals,\" he says.\n\n\"I will keep standing on the front line because I must do so.\"\n\n*Al Jazeera has used a pseudonym to protect the identity of Carlo because he is a minor.", "title": "Anti-fascists vow to fight Mussolini-loving 'militants'", "sourceId": "al-jazeera-english", "sourceName": "Al Jazeera English", "url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/anti-fascists-vow-fight-mussolini-loving-militants-180116190056142.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T05:53:40Z"}, {"textData": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Former U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic became the first man into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open when he ground down Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta 6-7(2) 6-3 7-6(0) 7-6(3) on Sunday.\n\nIn an entertaining baseline duel at the Margaret Court Arena, sixth seed Cilic blew away Carreno Busta in the tiebreaks to celebrate his 100th grand slam win.\n\nA former semi-finalist at Melbourne Park, Cilic also equaled Goran Ivanisevic\u2019s Croatian record of 11 grand slam quarter-final appearances.\n\nCarreno Busta showed heart to rally from a break down in the fourth set and push the match into a third tiebreak but was quickly overwhelmed by Cilic\u2019s firepower as the Croatian brought up four match points in a hurry.\n\nCilic blew one of them by spraying a crosscourt shot wide but made no mistake on the second, hammering a huge first serve down the \u2018T\u2019 and picking off the return with a straightforward forehand winner, bringing raucous cheers from the large Croatian contingent in the terraces.\n\nThe 2014 U.S. Open champion Cilic will meet either last year\u2019s finalist Rafa Nadal or Argentine Diego Schwartzman for a place in the semi-finals.\n\n\u201cIt was an unbelievable match, a lot of ups and downs,\u201d Cilic said in his on-court interview.\n\n\u201cPablo came back and really gave me a lot of trouble ...

That number is now 35.\n\nHowever, the remaining nine are among the biggest and most lucrative in the world: Football, golf and cricket among them.\n\nSerena Williams is the only female in the world's 100 highest-paid athletes. Recent studies suggested gender equality in football is worse than in politics, business and medicine.\n\nEven in tennis, away from the Grand Slams, the gap remains considerable.\n\nEarlier this month, Nick Kyrgios pocketed $83,650 for winning the Brisbane International. Julia Goerges, meanwhile, earned $43,000 for winning a similar-level event in Auckland.\n\nAdding endorsements, the gulf widens.

Too many women's sports are trying to compete with men's sports on men's terms. They're chasing after the same sponsors and the same TV channels.\n\n\"Because of the male-biased demographics of those channels, they don't necessarily get the same viewing figures, creating a perception that the audience isn't there for women's sports and that it's just an add-on to the men's game.\"\n\nAlmost 99 percent of all sponsorship money - the amount that dictates footballers' salaries and the prize pool for tennis and golf events - is directed at men's sport. Golf executives believe the women's game has struggled to attract an even share because their tournaments are often billed as space-fillers in the broadcasting schedules between men's tournaments.\n\nLichtenhein believes one of the key ways to increase the amount of money available to female athletes is to reach out to different TV channels and online streaming platforms not traditionally associated with sport.\n\n\"We're seeing some progress.

Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nThe crossing symbolizes Europe\u2019s past and present, though the question troubling Pan is what it will mean for the future.\n\nItalian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler cemented their partnership in World War II here. As the European Union helped foster postwar peace, customs and immigration checks melted away. Now the busiest pass through the Alps encapsulates what\u2019s shaping up as the continent\u2019s defining challenge in 2018: Should governments respond to the frustrations that boosted populists in elections last year with more EU integration, or less?\n\nEconomies are growing again, the flow of refugees has abated, yet a nationalist undercurrent still threatens to submerge the Franco-German vision for the European project.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has taken the lead in pressing to recapture the political initiative and strengthen the EU so it can start solving the problems that have prompted voters to turn to extremists. Key areas he has identified for deepened integration include intelligence sharing and defense, control of the bloc\u2019s outer borders, and a budget for the euro area.\n\nGermany may be getting on board. A preliminary coalition deal reached between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Party and the center-left Social Democrats puts \u201cA New Start for Europe\u201d at the top of its list of priorities.\n\nLast week, Mario Centeno, the new group head for the euro region\u2019s finance ministers, said that the coming months offer a \u201cunique window of opportunity\u201d to strengthen the common currency. He called for agreement by the EU\u2019s June summit to unify banking and capital markets regulation, and to increase fiscal burden sharing.\n\nNational electoral commissions\n\nBut persuading the EU\u2019s 28 nations to agree on game-changing projects is likely to be tough, even with the perennially awkward British heading for the exit door.\n\nEuroskeptic nationalist politicians now run Hungary and Poland. In March, Italy is expected to hold elections that could produce a less pro-European government in Rome. Meanwhile, the far-right Freedom Party of Austria recently joined a coalition government in Vienna. Its party members or affiliates head the foreign, interior and defense ministries.\n\nLast week alone, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung he was \u201cmuch more skeptical\u201d about creating a common budget for the euro area, while Interior Minister Herbert Kickl said infrastructure was needed to \u201cconcentrate\u201d asylum seekers. In an interview published on Friday, he also announced the creation of a \u201cstandby force\u201d ready to man check points on Austria's frontiers within hours of getting the order.\n\nJust how awkward the divisions can be was on display at the last EU summit, in December. A two-hour debate on immigration went so badly that EU President Donald Tusk said it was proving \u201chard to even find common language.\u201d He too gave leaders until June to come to an agreement.\n\nEven the Netherlands\u2019 center-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte has warned that Europe\u2019s project of \u201cever closer union\u201d is a threat, rather than a solution for liberal democracy.\n\n\u201cNo more institutions or even further integration,\u201d Rutte told the European Parliament\u2019s grouping of liberal parties in December. \u201cLook and you will see that the people of Europe are screaming to us through the ballot boxes. They are not wrong. You are wrong.\u201d\n\nSoldiers patrol the streets near the Brenner Pass outlet mall in Brennero. Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nIn Brennero, the village on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass, Pan and others from the German-speaking South Tyrol region, are disturbed by the prospect of an EU that becomes fractured by a return of 20th century nationalism or stops integrating further.\n\nImmigration is at the heart of it. As more than 1 million refugees from Syria, North Africa and elsewhere landed by sea in Greece and Italy in 2015 and 2016, many made their way north to Germany through the Brenner Pass. Austria\u2019s defense minister at one point said he had readied tanks and troops to block the pass if need be.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the economic hit. Last year, about 2.2 million trucks barreled through the mountain crossing. Steady streams of freight and passenger trains run on tracks either side of the highway, carrying goods and people north and south.\n\nBertelsmann Stiftung, January 2018 EUpinions report.\n\nPan\u2019s own Italian company is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of strudel, baking 35 kilometers (22 miles) of the tubular German pastry every day. Most of his consumers aren\u2019t in Italy, but to the north.\n\n\u201cLook at German cars. A year\u2019s production uses 4 billion euros worth of components from Italian manufacturers,\u201d he said, describing the Brenner Pass as part of a Europe-wide assembly line. \u201cMacron\u2019s plan is the way we have to go.\u201d\n\nOf course, the European economy managed healthy growth for decades before the visa-free Schengen area began in 1995, despite internal border checks. But going back would be harder.\n\nIf border guards were put to work under the canopy over the Brenner Pass, \u201cwe\u2019d have 15 to 20 kilometer tailbacks,\u201d said Peter Mock, commissar of the highway police based in Sterzing, a small medieval town 11 miles into the Italian part of Tyrol. The number of trucks crossing the pass has increased by at least eight or nine times since 1995, he said.\n\nFritz Karl Messner Photographer: Marc Champion/Bloomberg\n\nThere\u2019s a political worry, too. South Tyrol is a land of schnitzel and beer, more than pasta and wine. It was part of Austria until 1919, when Italy annexed it. Only the negotiation of substantial autonomy from Rome and an increasingly lax border with Austria enabled nationalist passions to subside.\n\nThe flow of refugees coming to Europe has fallen dramatically since last year. Still, soldiers wearing the distinctive raven-feathered caps of Italy\u2019s Alpini brigades patrol the short streets around the Brenner Pass outlet mall. It\u2019s the same regiment that accompanied Mussolini to his meeting with Hitler, in 1940.\n\nFritz Karl Messner, the mayor of Sterzing -- Vipiteno in Italian -- said that for now locals in the little snow-covered ski resort are coping fine with the handful of asylum seekers who have settled here to work. On a recent visit, two African migrants were handing out fliers at either end of the town\u2019s medieval high street.\n\nSpeaking at his offices in the regional capital Bolzano -- Bozen in German -- Governor Arno Kompatscher described the two parts of today\u2019s Tyrol, Austrian and Italian, as a model for the kind of integration the EU needs more of.\n\nSupport for rejoining Austria is marginal, but hardened borders and resurgent nationalism could change that, he said: \u201cThis is a little Europe within Europe.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by John Follain, and Jonathan Tirone", "title": "Now Comes the Fight Over Europe\u2019s Future", "sourceId": "bloomberg", "sourceName": "Bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-21/now-comes-the-fight-over-europe-s-future", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T05:01:09Z"}, {"textData": "In a fiery speech at a MoveOn rally outside the Capitol on Friday evening, Gutierrez accused President Donald Trump of exposing himself as a racist with his \u201cshithole\u201d countries remarks.

they are mostly young adults in their 20s and 30s competing for jobs against young Americans.\u00a0\u00a0Despite the growing economy, young American adults are struggling in the workforce, with an\u00a0unemployment rate\u00a0of nine percent. \u00a0And\u00a0young Americans without a college degree (66 percent of them) are suffering an\u00a0underemployment rate\u00a0(unemployed or seeking full time work)\u00a0that stands at a whopping 34\u00a0percent.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf one party or the other threatened a government shutdown in order to protect the\u00a0interests of American\u00a0citizens,\u00a0that\u00a0would be\u00a0one thing. \u00a0But\u00a0shutting down the government\u00a0to protect the interests of aliens who have broken our laws is something entirely different.\u00a0\u00a0And doing so to\u00a0force\u00a0a policy that hurts American citizens is unconscionable.\nThe second battle that illustrates this same disturbing disregard for American citizens is the\u00a0sanctuary cities fight. \u00a0The sanctuary cities that shelter illegal aliens from federal law enforcement are virtually all Democrat Party strongholds. \u00a0And the sanctuary state of California is firmly under Democratic control.\u00a0\u00a0Now the defense of sanctuary policies has become a rallying cry for the Democratic Party.\nBut here too, Democrats are putting Americans last. \u00a0By interfering with federal efforts to deport illegal aliens, sanctuary jurisdictions hurt American citizens.

The political agenda here is clear: to take away access to safe, legal abortion.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice has launched a federal investigation into Planned Parenthood\u2019s practices and its alleged involvement in the sale of body parts of aborted babies for profit.\nIn 2013, a lobbyist for the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates\u00a0argued against similar legislation in that state.\n\nDuring a subcommittee meeting regarding H.B. 1129 \u2013 the Infants Born Alive Act \u2013 Planned Parenthood lobbyist, Alisa Laport Snow, suggested that killing a baby who survived an abortion is acceptable as long as the physician and patient agreed to it.\nThe House passed the Born Alive Act on Friday, the day tens of thousands of pro-life activists descended upon Washington, DC, for the annual March for Life. The March is held on the anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the case of\u00a0Roe v.

The other lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, is a former Soviet military intelligence officer and an ally of Veselnitskaya who also advocates against the Magnitsky Act.\n\nBoth attended a party on Inauguration Day last year at the Library of Congress that was sponsored by Russia-friendly Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's campaign committee, The Post reported.\n\nIt was not the first time Rohrabacher had interacted with Veselnitskaya. The two also met in Moscow in April 2016 to discuss issues related to the Magnitsky Act, a law Russian President Vladimir Putin has derided as a \"purely political, unfriendly act.\"\n\nVeselnitskaya and Akhmetshin invited scrutiny last July, when news of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting first broke. Trump Jr. said in response to initial reports about the meeting that they discussed Russian adoptions and not campaign business. He was forced to amend his statement, however, when it emerged that he accepted the meeting after being offered kompromat on then Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nThat meeting, its attendees, and the Trump campaign's subsequent response have been a red-hot focus for special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional intelligence committees investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn addition to Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin \u2014 both of whom are under FBI scrutiny \u2014 at least four other politically influential Russians attended Trump's Inauguration Day celebrations last year, according to The Post.\n\n'Kremlin Connection'\n\nWealthy Russian pharmaceutical executive Alexey Repik and his wife were there, as was energy tycoon Viktor Vekselberg. Vekselberg is said to be closely aligned with Putin, with whom he frequently meets to discuss business. According to federal filings reviewed by The Post, two of Vekselberg's American associates donated a combined $1.25 million to Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nAlso in attendance was Russian presidential candidate Boris Titov. Though Titov is running as a liberal-leaning competitor to Putin in the country's 2018 presidential race, he is part of the Kremlin establishment and is friends with the Russian leader, according to The Moscow Times.\n\nAvid gun rights activist Maria Butina was also there. The Daily Beast reported last year that Butina has referred to herself at various times as a Russian central bank staffer, a gun enthusiast, a graduate student (she studies at American University in Washington, D.C.), a journalist, \"a representative of the Russian Federation,\" and a link between the Trump campaign and Russia. She also served as an assistant to Putin-allied Russian banker and politician Alexander Torshin, who has been accused in the past of money laundering and other financial crimes.\n\nButina had a birthday party on November 12, 2016, four days after Trump was elected, at a cafe near American University, according to the report. The gathering featured several top Trump campaign advisers and National Rifle Association activist and Republican strategist Paul Erickson, who reportedly told attendees Butina was on the Trump transition team. Butina and Erickson have been acquainted since at least 2013, and Erickson has touted himself as being well-connected to the Kremlin.\n\nErickson invited scrutiny last year, when The New York Times reported that he emailed Trump campaign aide Rick Dearborn in May 2016, with the subject line \"Kremlin Connection,\" telling him that he could arrange a backdoor meeting between Trump and Putin.\n\nRussia is \"quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the US,\" Erickson wrote, according to the email, which was described to The Times. He added that Russia would try to make contact with the Trump campaign at the NRA's annual convention in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTorshin was the individual designated to make \"first contact\" with Trump from Russia's side. Erickson described him in his email as \"President Putin's emissary on this front.\"\n\nErickson wrote that Torshin would make \"first contact\" with the campaign at a dinner honoring wounded veterans that was organized by conservative Christian advocate Rick Clay, the report said. Neither Trump nor his campaign advisers attended the reception. Trump Jr. and Torshin did, however, attend a separate NRA dinner the same night.\n\nInvestigators are said to be reviewing the correspondence and any others related to Dearborn, Erickson, Clay, and Torshin. The FBI, in particular, appears to be homing in on Torshin's role in leveraging the NRA to influence the US election.\n\nMcClatchy reported this week that the bureau is looking into whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA to help sway the race in Trump's favor. The NRA, according to the report, said it spent a record $55 million on the election, most of which came from a sector of the organization that isn't required to disclose its donors.\n\nThe US's former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, told The Post it was \"strange\" that so many Putin-linked individuals attended Trump's inauguration.\n\nBut Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who served as Senior Director of the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said he wasn't surprised.\n\n\"This team courted and potentially colluded with the Russians since day one without any apparent shame,\" he said in an email. \"I would've been surprised had prominent Russians NOT attended the inauguration.

Lookout security researcher Michael Flossman said the trove ran the gamut, from Syrian battlefield photos to private phone conversations, passwords and pictures of children's birthday parties.\n\n\"It was everything. Literally everything,\" Flossman said.\n\nDiscoveries of state-sponsored cyberespionage campaigns have become commonplace as countries in the Middle East and Asia scramble to match the digital prowess of the United States, China, Russia and other major powers. But Lookout and EFF's report is unusual for the amount of data uncovered about the spying campaign's victims and its operators.\n\nNotably, their report drew on data generated by suspected test devices \u2014 a set of similarly configured phones that appear to have been used to try out the spy software \u2014 to potentially pinpoint the hackers' exact address.\n\nThe report said the suspected test devices all seemed to have connected to a WiFi network active at the intersection of Beirut's Pierre Gemayel and Damascus Streets, the location of the bulky, sandstone-colored high-rise that houses Lebanon's General Directorate of General Security. The Associated Press was able to at least partially verify that finding, sending a reporter to the area around the heavily guarded, antenna-crowned building Wednesday to confirm that the same WiFi network was still broadcasting there.\n\nOther data also points to the intelligence agency: the report said the internet protocol addresses of the spyware's control panels mapped to an area just south of the GDGS building.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation Director of Cybersecurity Eva Galperin said the find was remarkable, explaining that she could think of only one other example where researchers were able to pin state-backed hackers to a specific building.\n\n\"We were able to take advantage of extraordinarily poor operational security,\" she said.\n\nThe GDGS did not immediately comment on the report.\n\nThe 49-page document lays out how spies used a network of bogus websites and malicious smartphone apps \u2014 such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Threema and Signal \u2014 to steal passwords or pry into communications, eavesdropping on conversations and capturing at least 486,000 text messages. Some victims were tricked into visiting the websites or downloading the rogue apps by booby trapped messages sent over WhatsApp, the report said. Others may have had malicious programs installed physically when they were away from their phones.

Democrats showed little sign of budging on the first day after federal funding ran dry. But the rhetoric is growing ever more heated, as each side seeks to land on just the message that will allow them to prevail in the battle for public opinion.\nStory Continued Below\nThe real challenge for Democrats, both sides suggest, will come Monday morning. If the government is still shut down, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to stay home from work and the true scale of the crisis will start to hit the American public, raising the noise level of the fight dramatically. For Republicans, the issue is keeping President Donald Trump from a major mistake, making him the focus and not Democrats.\nSo far, the GOP has hit the \"illegal immigration\" angle hardest.\n\u201cDonald Trump was elected President to build the wall and keep American families safe from evil, illegal immigrants who commit violent crimes against lawful U.S. citizens,\u201d asserts a web ad released by the Trump campaign on Saturday afternoon. It includes pictures of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \u201cYet, one year after President Trump\u2019s Inauguration, Chuck Schumer and the Democrats continue to put the interests of illegal immigrants over those of Americans.\u201d \nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders chimed in as well: \u201cWe will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators.\u201d\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY.) invoked the \u201cDemocrats are supporting illegal immigration\u201d line, too, tagging Schumer on the Senate floor Saturday. \u201cBut like the president, like the House, and like a bipartisan majority of senators, the American people cannot begin to understand why the Senate Democratic leader thinks the entire government should be shut down until he gets his way on illegal immigration,\u201d McConnell said.\nSign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\nBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) denounced the Trump ad as \u201cvile.\u201d\nSchumer \u2014 in by far his biggest moment as Senate minority leader \u2014 has largely held his caucus together so far, including several red state Democrats up for reelection in 2018. Five of those vulnerable senators did cross the aisle and vote with McConnell on Friday.\nWhether Schumer can keep his troops in line under pressure from Trump, McConnell and the entire GOP political machine is the big question, especially if the shutdown extends into next week or beyond.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this political world, in the most toxic place in that world \u2014 Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), who is running for another term in November. Manchin voted with Republicans Friday night to fund the government for four more weeks. \u201cWith that being said, everyone should be working together to get this government open.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s misrepresenting us, of course. He does that on a regular basis,\u201d Sen. Bob Casey (Pa.), another Democrat up this year, said of McConnell. Casey opposed the GOP funding proposal. \u201cIf he wanted to bring the country together, he\u2019d be fighting for his coal miners like I\u2019m fighting for mine.\u201d\nDemocrats also criticized Republicans for the controversy over Dreamers in the first place, noting that it was Trump who decided in September to end protections granted to recipients under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program initiated by President Barack Obama.\n\u201cWhy does he call them illegals? Who made them illegal?\u201d asked Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) of McConnell. \u201cWhen he stands up and calls DACA kids illegal immigrants \u2014 they are [actually] legal. They got protection from the president. He\u2019s trying to make them illegal by ending the program, but they are here legally.\u201d\n\nPolitics\n\n            By POLITICO STAFF\nEmerging from a closed-door meeting on Saturday, rank-and-file Senate Democrats appeared comfortable with their party\u2019s positioning and message. Several of them said there had not been much dissension, and that the caucus remains united behind Schumer and the leadership. Still, lawmakers in both parties acknowledged that the real pressure won\u2019t begin until Monday. Many Republicans are convinced Schumer will fold before then.\nDemocrats also believe that in Trump, they have a villain they can successfully tag with causing the shutdown. This is the first time that federal employees will be furloughed because of a shutdown that occurred with one party controlling the White House and Congress.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s and congressional Republican\u2019s responsibility to govern. It\u2019s their responsibility to keep the doors open and the lights on around here. But the Republican leadership can\u2019t get a tumultuous president on board with anything, and they don\u2019t offer us any compromises on their own,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor on Saturday.\n\nCongress\n\n            By ALEX ISENSTADT and GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI\nSchumer relayed details from his 90-minute meeting with Trump on Friday, saying he offered funding for a border wall \u2014 anathema to Democrats \u2014 in return for full protections for DACA recipients. Schumer thought he had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in his talks with the president, only to have Trump later call him to shoot down a potential deal. \nSchumer said it's become an ongoing pattern with Trump, which Democrats and Republicans would both agree on, though perhaps not in public.\nThe Trump campaign web ad, which calls Democrats \"complicit\" in any murders committed by illegal immigrants, provoked an angry response.\n\"This is a shameless attempt by the president to distract from the Trump shutdown,\" said Schumer's spokesman, Matt House. \nRepublicans, also playing the branding game, have dubbed the government closure: \"#SchumerShutdown.\"\nMissing out on the latest scoops?

(Vincenzo Pinto/AFP Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLIMA, Peru \u2014 Pope Francis is wrapping up the most contested, violent trip of his papacy Sunday with a series of meetings with Peruvian church leaders and a final Mass at an air base in Peru\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Mass is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of Peruvian faithful before his departure to Rome \u2014 a potentially stark contrast to the pontiff\u2019s send-off from Chile, where his final homily drew thousands less than anticipated and thin crowds lined the streets to wave goodbye.\n\n\u201cHopefully early tomorrow, myself and all of Peru will get a chance to see him up close,\u201d said Nicolas Astete, one of more than 3,000 people who gathered Saturday night outside the Apostolic Nunciature in Lima, hoping to see a glimpse of the pope before he retired for the evening.\n\n\u201cCome here!\u201d the crowds cried as Francis made his way to the papal embassy.\n\nDespite the thunderous welcome the pontiff has received throughout his trip to Peru, the uproar over the Catholic Church\u2019s handling of a clerical sex abuse scandal in Chile and Francis\u2019 own remarks on the case have continued to cast a shadow over the visit. All ears will be tuned in Sunday to any final words Francis might share on a crisis he had hoped to help mend in a visit to usually friendly Latin American turf.\n\nDuring his seven-day trip Chile and Peru Francis personally apologized to survivors of priests who sexually abused them, traveled deep into the Amazon to meet with indigenous leaders, decried the scourge of corruption and violence against women in Latin America and urged the Chilean government and radical Mapuche factions to peacefully resolve one of the region\u2019s longest-running disputes.\n\nBut the pope also attracted unprecedented rejection: At least a dozen churches across Chile were set aflame and riot police shot tear gas and arrested protesters who tried marching in on Mass in Santiago.\n\nFrancis stirred outrage when he accused victims of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile priest of slander. The 81-year-old Argentine said that until he sees proof that Bishop Juan Barros was complicit in covering up any crimes, accusations of complicity by the victims of against Barros are \u201call calumny.\u201d\n\nThat remark prompted even Francis\u2019 top adviser on clerical abuse to issue a stunning criticism of the pontiff, calling his words a \u201csource of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nThe rebuke Saturday came as Francis was consoling Peruvians in a coastal northern city hard hit by El Nino floods that left more than 150 dead nationwide last year. During Francis\u2019 three days in Peru he has also tackled heavy social issues, calling on corporations to stop exploitative drilling in the Amazon, for governments to recognize indigenous people and for greater transparency in politics.\n\nFrancis will conclude his trip by visiting some of Lima\u2019s holiest sites.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Cesar Barreto contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained at a historically low level, compared with past presidents. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAmericans have reached a split-screen assessment of the state of the country at the end of President Trump\u2019s first year in office, expressing the most positive views about the economy in nearly two decades while giving Trump historically low approval, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News survey.\n\nThis stark contrast between perceptions of the economy and assessments of the president continue a pattern that has existed since Trump was sworn in a year ago, that of a president whose personal actions and behavior have stirred controversy and created a political distraction in the face of steady growth, low unemployment and record gains in the stock market.\n\nHow voters weigh those two views will have a decided impact on the upcoming midterm elections. Democrats, who see an opportunity take back control of the House and have a possible although uphill path to control of the Senate, will seek to make the November elections about Trump. Republicans hope perceptions of the economy will influence enough voters to hold down their expected losses enough to protect that House majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new survey finds that 58 percent of all Americans give positive ratings to the state of the economy. That is the highest in a Post-ABC survey in 17 years and seven points higher than on the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration. At the same time, Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained at a historically low level, compared with past presidents. Today, 36 percent approve of the job Trump is doing, while 58 percent disapprove, little changed over the past few months. Strong disapproval of the president, at 49 percent overall, remains twice as high as strong approval, which stands at 24 percent.\n\n[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted]\n\nThe public is evenly divided overall and deeply split along partisan lines on three major policy initiatives of the Trump presidency \u2014 the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants, a reduction in federal regulations on businesses, and an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce. More than 4 in 10 support those policies, and an almost-identical percentage oppose them. But the level of support is slightly higher than Trump\u2019s approval rating, meaning that some Americans \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 who disapprove of the president support those policies.\n\nOn two of the biggest policy debates of the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 health care and taxes \u2014 the public comes down in opposition to the direction pursued by the administration and congressional Republicans. A majority (57 percent) say the continuation of the Affordable Care Act is a good thing, in essence an expression of relief that Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare as they had long promised to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the big tax bill passed by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump at the end of last year, 46 percent say it is bad for the country while 34 percent say it is good for the country. That is slightly better than when people were asked whether they supported or opposed the measure as it was being debated. Notably, 20 percent say they have no opinion or are ambivalent about the tax bill, which is likely to become a pivotal battleground for public opinion between the parties ahead of the November midterm elections.\n\nThe gap between the president\u2019s low approval and the somewhat higher level of support for some of his policies reflects the disconnect between how people see the president and how they view some of his priorities. For example, 21 percent of Democrats who disapprove of the president say the crackdown on undocumented immigrants is a good thing for the country. The same percentage of disapproving Democrats say reducing federal regulations on business is good for the country.\n\nFor their part, Democrats are struggling to convey a message beyond being anti-Trump, with just over 3 in 10 saying they are presenting alternatives to Trump\u2019s proposals. A 53 percent majority say the Democratic Party is mainly criticizing the president without offering alternatives.\n\nAs the president begins his second year in office, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and possible cooperation, collusion or knowledge of what was taking place by associates of the Trump campaign continues. Trump has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d although it has produced two guilty pleas, including one from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and charges against Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, and an associate of Manafort\u2019s.\n\nToday, 50 percent of Americans approve of the way Mueller is proceeding compared with 31 percent who disapprove, with 19 percent expressing no opinion. In early November, 58 percent approved of Mueller\u2019s handling, but in recent weeks, Republicans have targeted the investigation as biased. Among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, approval of Mueller has dropped from 39 percent in November to 30 percent in the new poll.\n\nHalf of all Americans also say they believe Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Russians, and an almost identical percentage say they believe the president tried to interfere with the investigation. Just over a quarter, 26 percent, say they believe there is solid evidence to buttress this latter assessment.\n\nThe impact of Trump\u2019s leadership on the public is mixed to negative. Six in 10 Americans say he has accomplished little or nothing. That is better than the 65 percent who said this in November, before passage of the tax bill, but it is a worse rating than received by former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at a similar point in their first terms. A bare majority (53 percent) say Trump\u2019s actions have made no difference to them and their families. The rest are roughly split about the effect of his presidency on them, with 26 percent saying his actions have hurt and 20 percent saying they\u2019ve helped.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the economy, Trump receives less credit for the gains seen over the past than does his predecessor, Obama. Fewer than 4 in 10, 38 percent, say the Trump administration deserves significant credit for the state of the economy while 50 percent say the Obama administration should get credit. Republicans and Democrats have sharply opposite views of where the credit should go. Among independents, one-third say Trump should get credit, compared with about half who give credit to Obama.\n\nAbout 1 in 4 Americans rate the economy positively while disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance. Three-quarters of them are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, and most of the group says Obama deserves credit for the current state of the economy, not Trump. Even more important is the fact that almost all of them say Trump has acted in a way that is not presidential, one indicator of how his personal behavior has clouded his presidency.\n\nThe survey finds that Trump and the Republicans have so far failed to shift public opinion on key elements of their agenda. Republican leaders have said that the new tax law \u2014 the party\u2019s biggest accomplishment to date \u2014 will provide lower taxes for most middle-class families. But at this point, 60 percent of Americans see the new measure overall as favoring the rich rather than the middle class or the poor.\n\nOpposition to Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to curtail illegal immigration remains strong, with 63 percent of Americans saying they are against it, including 52 percent who strongly oppose. But 71 percent of Republicans support the proposal, including 58 percent who support it strongly. The gulf between Republicans on one side and Democrats and independents on the other underscores why this part of border security has been a sticking point in budget negotiations between the two parties.\n\nCongress has been at a stalemate over the future of the Obama-era policy that protected from deportation undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children. The issue has been a point of contention in recent days as Congress has struggled to reach a spending agreement. Trump rescinded the Obama program last fall and asked Congress to come up with a solution by March. So far that fix has eluded negotiators.\n\nPublic opinion is clear on this issue, with 87 percent of Americans saying they support a continuation of the protection for those undocumented young people who have completed high school or served in the military and who have no serious criminal record. On this, there is bipartisan agreement among overwhelming majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\nTrump\u2019s behavior and fitness shape the other track of his presidency, to his detriment. Seven in 10 Americans say he has acted in a way that is not presidential, while a quarter say his behavior has been fitting and proper for the nation\u2019s chief executive. About 2 in 3 say the president\u2019s use of Twitter has hurt his presidency. A bare majority (52 percent) say he is biased against black people.\n\nThe president in a recent tweet, which came after a renewed round of questions about his stability in light of a new book that described him in unflattering terms, said he was both mentally stable and a \u201cgenius\u201d for being able to win the White House in his first try for public office. On those two questions, Americans are almost split evenly about his mental stability but by better than 3 to 1 say he is not a genius.\n\nTrump recently underwent a physical examination that included a test aimed at detecting mild cognitive impairment. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House\u2019s top physician, said the president had a perfect score on the test and dismissed questions about his mental competence.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll was conducted Jan. 15-18, 2018, among a random sample of 1,005 adults reached on cell and landline phones with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.", "title": "Poll finds public optimistic about the economy, critical of Trump, split on issues - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-finds-public-optimistic-about-the-economy-critical-of-trump-split-on-issues/2018/01/20/30cb803c-fd51-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T05:01:56Z"}, {"textData": "The Moon in Pisces connects with Pluto at 5:22 AM, encouraging us to explore deep and difficult emotions.

Gunmen stormed the hotel in the Afghan capital on Saturday evening, triggering a shootout with security forces, officials said. (Rahmat Gul/Associated Press)\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Gunmen stormed the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul, killing at least five people, including a foreigner, and setting off a 12-hour gunbattle with security forces that continued into Sunday morning, as frantic guests tried to escape from fourth and fifth-floor windows.\n\nSix other people, including three security forces, were reported wounded, and more than 150 people, including 41 foreigners, have been rescued from the hotel, said Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish.\n\nThe bodies of three attackers were recovered as security forces continued to clear the landmark building, he said. \u201cFor the time being we can only confirm that one foreigner was among those who were killed in the attack,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe security forces are going room-by-room to make sure that there are no more attackers in the building,\u201d Danish said.\n\nThe Intercontinental Hotel is located on a hilltop in the Bagh-e Bala area of the capital and is heavily guarded because it hosts both Afghan and foreign guests as well as official conferences. Last night\u2019s attack unfolded almost six years after Taliban insurgents launched a similar assault.\n\nThe property is not part of the InterContinental chain of worldwide hotels.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said a private firm assumed responsibility for securing the hotel around three weeks ago. The ministry says it is investigating how the attackers managed to enter the building.\n\nAfghan security officials confirmed that 34 provincial officials were gathered at the hotel to participate in a conference organized by the Telecommunication Ministry.\n\nNo one has immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which started around 9 p.m. Saturday. As the fighting raged, a fire broke out. Firefighters are still battling the blaze. Live TV footage showed people trying to escape through windows on the upper stories.\n\nCapt. Tom Gresback, spokesman for NATO-led forces, said in a statement that Afghan forces were leading the response efforts. He said that according to initial reports, no foreign troops were hurt in the attack.\n\nAfghan forces have struggled to combat the Taliban since the U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. They have also had to contend with a growing Islamic State affiliate that has carried out a number of massive attacks in recent years.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Al Bello/Getty Images)\n\nLamont Peterson bristled last week when asked what his approach would be as an overwhelming underdog heading into his next fight. The District boxer didn\u2019t consider himself as such, he said defiantly, despite oddsmakers heavily favoring youthful champion Errol Spence Jr. in their welterweight title bout Saturday night at Barclays Center.\n\nBut reality and age caught up with Peterson as Spence administered a thorough beating through seven rounds. By the start of Round 8, Barry Hunter, Peterson\u2019s trainer, had seen enough, stopping the fight with Peterson\u2019s right eye barely open and his face showing the damage resulting from ferocious blows from the International Boxing Federation titleholder.\n\nPeterson (35-4-1, 17 knockouts) lost for second time in his past four fights, leaving his future in doubt ahead of his 34th birthday later this month. Spence, 28, continued his rapid ascent in the sport\u2019s most competitive weight class and remained undefeated at 23-0 with 20 KOs.\n\n\u201cHe was getting his shots off,\u201d Peterson said during an in-ring interview. \u201cHe was a better man tonight.\u201d\n\nThe proceedings tilted significantly toward Spence in the fifth round, when a left hook caught Peterson flush, bringing the crowd of 12,107 to its feel. Peterson stumbled, then tumbled to the canvas while trying to brace his fall with both gloves. Peterson was examined after the round and permitted to answer the bell for Round 6.\n\nBut the punishment continued for two more rounds and, after consulting with Peterson\u2019s corner and the attending doctor, referee Harvey Dock signaled for the stoppage.\n\n\u201cI know Lamont. He\u2019s a tough fighter,\u201d Spence said. \u201cA lot of guys would have stayed down [after the knockdown], but he wanted to keep going. That\u2019s the kind of fighter Lamont is.\u201d\n\nThe early rounds also favored Spence, a left-hander who commanded the center of the ring while moving Peterson around with jabs. A right hand caught Peterson squarely in Round 2, sending him shuffling backward before he regained his balance and was able to counter.\n\nSpence began to ramp up his attack in the third round, getting through Peterson\u2019s attentive defensive posture to land hits to the body and several times to the head, leaving his face a reddish hue.\n\nAsked in the ring after the bout whether he would consider retirement, Peterson, the former IBF and World Boxing Association champion at 140 pounds, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a decision I have to make right now, but it\u2019s something I will think about the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nPeterson fought for the first time since Feb. 18, 2017, when in his 147-pound debut he beat Russia\u2019s David Avanesyan in Cincinnati to claim a secondary WBA welterweight title. Keith Thurman owns the primary WBA super world welterweight championship.\n\nIn early October, Peterson voluntarily relinquished the WBA belt, clearing the way for the showdown with Spence, who won the IBF title last year by traveling to Sheffield, England, the home town of then-champion Kell Brook, and collecting a knockout in the 11th round.\n\nPeterson\u2019s previous three losses came against Timothy Bradley Jr., Lucas Matthysse and Danny Garcia. He also had a draw against Victor Ortiz.\n\n\u201cIt was hard,\u201d Hunter said of electing to stop the fight. \u201cIf you know Lamont, you know his courage. At the end of the day, this is my son. I don\u2019t care more about boxing than I care about him.\u201d\n\nPeterson\u2019s younger brother Anthony fought on the undercard as a super lightweight, dispatching Luis Eduardo Florez in nondescript fashion via 10-round unanimous decision. Two judges scored the bout 110-89, and a third had it 100-90 in Anthony Peterson\u2019s first fight in nearly two years. He last fought April 1, 2016, defeating Samuel Kotey Neequaye, also in a 10-round unanimous decision, at the D.C. Armory.\n\nAnthony Peterson (38-1, 24 KOs) suffered his lone loss against Brandon Rios, a high-quality opponent, in 2010 via disqualification.

(Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Koreans seem generally happy they\u2019ll see the North Koreans at their Olympics, but aren\u2019t as pleased about sharing a team with them.\n\nThe agreement between the war-separated rivals to field a unified women\u2019s ice hockey team at February\u2019s Winter Olympics has triggered a debate in South Korea, where there\u2019s no longer strong public clamor for reunification or for using sports to make political statements.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who views the Pyeongchang Games as an opportunity to improve relations following a year of tension over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, said the unified team would provide a \u201chistorically grand moment\u201d once it appears on ice.\n\nOther reconciliatory gestures the Koreas have agreed to for the Olympics include a joint march under a blue-and-white \u201cunification\u201d flag during the Feb. 9 opening ceremony and a pair of performances by a visiting North Korean art troupe. The joint march and the unified hockey team were approved Saturday by the International Olympic Committee, which allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the games in exceptional entries given to the North.\n\nNot all South Koreans are in the mood. There are apparently few objections to the North Korean presence at the Olympics itself, which likely ensures that the country holds off any significant weapons test or other aggressive acts that would risk disrupting the games.\n\nMany South Koreans believe their government went too far by pushing athletes into a \u201cpolitical show\u201d that will likely become meaningless once the lull in tensions breaks down after the Olympics.\n\nKim Hye-jin, a 39-year-old music instructor, said that South Korea was repeating an \u201coutdated approach\u201d in using sports diplomacy. She said that the previous unified teams and joint marches between the rivals never paved the way for sustained, meaningful engagement.\n\n\u201cWe are always repeating meaningless things and North Korea isn\u2019t a country that will change easily,\u201d she said.\n\nPlus, she said, a unified team takes away opportunities from South Korean athletes who have been working hard to prepare for the Olympics.\n\nHeo Doo-won, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, didn\u2019t care for the reconciliatory gestures at all.\n\n\u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe are clearly two different countries and it\u2019s better if things stay that way. I don\u2019t want a unified team or a unification flag. Why can\u2019t we just let the North Koreans march under their own flag?\u201d\n\nWhile the liberal Moon remains a popular president nine months into his term, the controversy over the hockey team factored in his approval rating dipping below 70 percent for the first time in four months, according to a Gallup Korea report on Friday.\n\nMany people sympathize with the South Korean athletes who would likely be sacrificing opportunities for the North\u2019s players, who are considered less skilled and experienced. The IOC approved an expanded roster of 35 instead of 22 for the joint team, but only the normal number will be allowed to suit up for each game and three of them must be North Korean.\n\nThe South Korean team\u2019s Canadian coach, Sarah Murray, has expressed concerns over chemistry.\n\n\u201cAdding somebody so close to the Olympics is a little bit dangerous just for team chemistry because the girls have been together for so long,\u201d she said last week.\n\nChoi Hyuk, a 40-year-old office worker, blamed the government for failing to properly communicate with the players and for excessively politicizing sports.\n\nChoi pointed to the comments of Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, who was forced to apologize after saying that the South Korean women\u2019s hockey team was out of \u201cmedal range\u201d anyway while defending the government\u2019s decision to create the unified team.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s elite sports have always been based on nationalism,\u201d Choi said, referring to a decades-long system that rewards Olympic medal winners with lifelong cash payments and exemption from military duties that are mandatory for most able-bodied men.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny that the same country is now asking athletes to cut back on their playing time and embrace changes that would make them less likely to win?\u201d\n\nThe reconciliation mood between the Koreas began after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year\u2019s speech that he was willing to send a delegation to the Olympics.\n\nSome experts view Kim\u2019s overture as an attempt to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and buy time to further advance his nuclear weapons program. Last year, North Korea carried out its sixth and biggest nuclear test and test-fired three intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has shown no willingness to give up its ambitions.\n\nStill, many experts think Moon\u2019s government made the right move in jumping at the opportunity to resume contact with North Korea after nearly two years of diplomatic stalemate and animosity.\n\nIn an annual policy report on Friday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said it aims to use the Olympics as an opportunity to re-establish regular dialogue with North Korea. The resumption of inter-Korean talks is crucial for the policies of Moon, who wants Seoul in the driver\u2019s seat in international efforts to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat.\n\nThe Koreas sent joint teams to major international sporting events twice in 1991, and had their athletes march together in the opening and closing ceremonies of several sporting events in the 2000s, including the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile the previous moves had little diplomatic impact, similar gestures would carry more meaning in an Olympics held on South Korean soil and amid higher stakes in regional security, said Yongchul Chung, a sports education professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.\n\n\u201cFielding a unified team is very meaningful \u2014 the biggest fruit that can come from the Pyeongchang Olympics is a message of peace between the Koreas,\u201d Chung said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the players wouldn\u2019t understand the historic significance of what they are involved in.\u201d\n\nBut it has become harder to get South Koreans excited for unified teams and joint marches when North Korea\u2019s increasingly aggressive weapons tests and the South\u2019s own evolvement as an economy and society continue to erode the public\u2019s enthusiasm for reunification.\n\nIn a survey of 1,200 adults released by Seoul National University in October, 53.8 percent of the respondents said they supported the idea of reunification. This represented a steep drop from the 63.8 percent measured in 2007, when the school started the annual survey.\n\n\u201cI think it will be emotionally moving to watch the athletes of both Koreas march under the same flag during the opening ceremony as we come from the same nation,\u201d said Oh Ju-yeon, a 46-year-old housewife. \u201cBut after the games, there will be bitterness from realizing that nothing\u2019s really going to change.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(James Crisp/Associated Press)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 Florida worked through ugly play for much of the night against No. 18 Kentucky, and the persistent Gators eventually made the necessary shots to go ahead before holding on with several big defensive plays.\n\nOn both ends of the floor, Jalen Hudson came up big.\n\nHudson came off the bench to score 17 points, and Chris Chiozza, Keith Stone and Kevarrius Hayes contributed clutch baskets down the stretch as Florida rallied to upset the Wildcats 66-64 on Saturday night.\n\nThe first-place Gators (14-5, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) saw their 45-37 second-half lead become a 56-53 deficit before they regrouped behind Chiozza\u2019s 3-pointer, Hayes\u2019 jumper and Stone\u2019s layup to go ahead 62-58 with 2:02 remaining. KeVaughn Allen added two free throws with 44 seconds left before Hudson made two more from the line, shots that offset 3-pointers by Kevin Knox and Wenyen Gabriel.\n\nStone\u2019s missed free throw gave Kentucky a chance to tie at the end, but Egor Koulechov and Hudson blocked shots by Quade Green and PJ Washington respectively before stealing the inbounds pass with 2.5 seconds left to win for eighth time in nine tries and take a two-game SEC lead on the Wildcats (14-5, 4-3).\n\nKentucky had won 30 straight at home against SEC opponents and 16 in a row overall in Lexington.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t take home run shots\u201d down the stretch, said Hudson, who shot 4 of 13 overall and 2 of 8 from 3-point range. \u201cWe stayed poised.\u201d\n\nFlorida was especially calm in those final seconds as Kentucky tried to tie the game.\n\n\u201cWe just literally had to sit down in a stance the whole 25 seconds,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what they were going to do. ... We had to make sure that they drove into our hands and make them finish over us.\u201d\n\nNo foul was called on Washington\u2019s drive, and Kentucky coach John Calipari said he wasn\u2019t sure if there was one.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day we had our chances, and I love the fact we fought,\u201d Calipari said.\n\nStone finished with 14 points, Chiozza scored 13 with eight assists and Allen had 11 as Florida won despite shooting 33 percent (22 of 66) before 24,394 blue-clad fans at Rupp Arena.\n\n\u201cWinning at Rupp is enormous,\u201d Florida coach Mike White said. \u201cWe have 11 conference games left and it\u2019s a big win.\u201d\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander and Wenyen Gabriel had 10 points each for Kentucky, which lost its second in a row and third of five.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFlorida: The Gators shot just 20 percent from 3-point range (6 of 30), well below their SEC-leading 40 percent average coming in. But they got key perimeter shots from Hudson, Allen and Chiozza, and then closed the game by making their final three field goals. \u201cI thought Kentucky played really hard,\u201d White said. \u201cThey defended at such a high level.\u201d\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats shot 40 percent and won the boards 49-38 but went cold after taking their last lead. They also couldn\u2019t stop the Gators from making 3s in clutch moments. Kevin Knox had nine points, while Hamidou Diallo and Nick Richards had eight each. Green played 17 minutes after missing three games with a back issue but only made a layup in eight attempts, including four from long range.\n\nTOUGH CROWD\n\nWhite said ugly wins aren\u2019t new for Florida, which beat New Hampshire 70-63 in November while shooting 32 percent overall and 17 percent from long range. Doing it in a loud, hostile environment was a different story, but the Gators found a way to make it happen at Rupp.\n\n\u201cI promise, I didn\u2019t think that,\u201d said Chiozza, who was 5 of 11 shooting. \u201cBut we\u2019re showing that some games when we don\u2019t hit shots, we do a good job.\u201d\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nKentucky figures to fall a few spots after letting one slip away.

A blatant falsehood from the White House podium.\n\nAnd that was just the first 24 hours.\n\nIn his first year in office, Donald Trump proved to be a singular figure, casting aside norms and traditions, fighting with Republicans and Democrats alike and changing how the nation and the presidency are viewed at home and abroad.\n\nSeemingly each day spawned several can-you-believe-it headlines that would have defined a previous president\u2019s term. But in the hyper-accelerated Trump news cycle, many were forgotten by the next morning.\n\nAppropriate for a former reality TV star, Trump\u2019s first year was can\u2019t-miss drama, full of unforgettable characters, surprise casting changes and innumerable plot twists. It came against the backdrop of a deeply polarized nation, a looming nuclear threat, whispers about the president\u2019s fitness for office and, for good measure, the shadow of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe reviews weren\u2019t kind. Trump\u2019s first-year approval rating stood at 39 percent, the lowest of any president. But viewers couldn\u2019t look away.\n\n\u201cHe is a compulsively watchable political character,\u201d said Jon Meacham, presidential historian and biographer. \u201cThe country elected the most unconventional president in our history and he has proven to be just that. To me, the story of the first year is the atmospheric chaos that the president has created, sustained and perpetuated.\u201d\n\nTrump was the first president to be elected without any government or military experience. And from the first moments of Trump\u2019s inauguration, it was clear that Washington had never seen anything like this before.\n\nHis inaugural speech was a dark pitch to the nation\u2019s forgotten, suggesting a retreat from the world under the slogan of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d It soon led to an uproar over the White House press secretary\u2019s wild claims about the inauguration crowd size.\n\nSoon, other crowds were the story.\n\nMillions of people flooded streets around the globe for the \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d to protest Trump\u2019s presidency. That set the template for the so-called #Resistance, which swarmed airports just days later when the White House suddenly announced its travel ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThere would be little attempt from Trump to bring those protesters into the fold. Despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, the president forged forward as if elected with a sweeping mandate, aiming his policies directly at his base \u2014 with moves such as the rollback of environment regulations and civil rights protections \u2014 and blaming Democrats for any Washington failure.\n\nAlways eager to have a foe, Trump governed as he campaigned, and not just by incessantly reliving his 2016 election over Hillary Clinton. Trump frequently instigated fights and rarely let a slight go unanswered via his favorite weapon, his Twitter account.\n\nAny pre-inauguration talk of restraining his Twitter usage was soon forgotten. He used the 140-character \u2014 and later, up to 280 \u2014 bursts to target foes, traffic in conspiracy theories, salute the programming on Fox News, rattle Congress and unnerve world capitals. In March, he even made the unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor had wiretapped Trump Tower, and he labeled President Barack Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy.\u201d\n\nThe trail of tweets has roiled the capital for 12 months. Across Washington, phones would buzz with alerts anytime Trump tweeted. Republicans found themselves to be targets of Trump\u2019s tweet just like Democrats, particularly when their efforts to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 a plan seven years in the making \u2014 failed not once, but twice.\n\nSome tweets drew puzzlement; none more than the president\u2019s late-night posting of the nonsensical word \u201ccovfefe.\u201d\n\nSome tweets challenged American institutions, full of criticisms of the media and the FBI. Others provoked outrage, as when he suggested that MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski had a face-lift or claimed that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., \u201cwould do anything\u201d for a donation, an unsavory insinuation made at the height of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe discussion about sexual harassment toppled many powerful men but, while Trump\u2019s own accusers resurfaced, the White House never changed its story: The women were lying.\n\nThat was just one of many moments in which Trump appeared almost eager to foment divisions, including racial ones.\n\nHis political career was launched on the lie that Obama was not born in the United States, and this month, Trump was denounced for dismissing African nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d when he urged a limit on immigration from that continent.\n\nHe dismissed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d mocking her claims about being part Native American, while addressing a group of American Indians. More divisively, he blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence between neo-Nazis and anti-hate group protesters that left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nWhile Trump was rewriting the rules of behavior within the Oval Office, his agenda was largely lifted from the Republican playbook and his first year victories thrilled the GOP orthodoxy. He appointed conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, rolled back business regulations, presided over a massive tax cut and, the White House argued, fostered an environment that freed the stock market to boom.\n\n\u201c2017 was a year of tremendous achievement (and) the achievements for our country, our people, and for our standing in the world have been very monumental,\u201d Trump said at a Cabinet meeting last week, before offering a glimpse into how he views the presidency \u2014 as catnip for cable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure their ratings were fantastic. They always are,\u201d he said.\n\nLike any president, Trump faced crises during his first year.\n\nMost ominously, North Korea escalated its nuclear weapons development program while Trump responded with unprecedentedly bellicose rhetoric. He warned of \u201cfire and fury\u201d that could wipe out Pyongyang. At the United Nations, he insulted North Korean leader Kim Jung Un as \u201cLittle Rocket Man.\u201d Trump took to Twitter to suggest that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim\u2019s.\n\nThe anniversary of his inauguration coincided with a government shutdown, and he scoffed that Democrats \u201cwanted to give me a nice present.\u201d\n\nHe traveled overseas four times, upbraiding traditional American allies at NATO for not paying enough, basking in the flattery of Chinese President Xi Jinping and touching a mysterious, glowing orb with Saudi King Salman.\n\nHis responses to domestic tragedies were uneven.\n\nHe paid tribute to the 58 victims of a shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas, but made no effort to toughen gun control laws. When Hurricane Maria crushed Puerto Rico, leaving half the island without power for months, Trump feuded with a local mayor and, during a visit, distributed paper towels to survivors by shooting them like they were basketballs.\n\nBefitting a man whose reality show ended with a firing each week, in Trump\u2019s first year his administration\u2019s upper-level officials have had a turnover rate of 34 percent, much higher than any other in the past 40 years. Gone were chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer and, after just 11 eventful days, communications director Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nBut the circumstances of two exits above all may define not just Trump\u2019s first year in office, but those to follow.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Flynn was fired less than a month into the term for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with foreign officials. In May, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\nThat dismissal led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose probe into possible collusion and obstruction of justice has hovered over the White House. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and is now cooperating with Mueller. Trump himself may at some point be interviewed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a president who had such a chaotic first year. Every day is topsy-turvy and disorganized, the country has not been so divided since the Civil War and Trump thrives at being the bull that carries his own china shop around with him,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cHe\u2019s not like anything we\u2019ve seen before and this is the question: What are the consequences going to be?\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It was also Republicans, who grumbled just as loudly that they were not sure who in the White House was negotiating to end a partial government shutdown.\n\nWhich Trump was it: The ultimate deal-maker eager to deliver what eluded his predecessors from both parties or the firebrand who rode a hardline immigration stance to power? As with so many other moments of consequence for his presidency, it seemed the last person to speak with Trump determined his position.\n\nFor the President, it was not how he anticipated spending the one-year anniversary of his inauguration.\n\nThe White House\u2019s budget director and legislative liaison made the rounds at the Capitol. Its press secretary called lawmakers \u201closers.\u201d The chief of staff seemed to reverse his boss\u2019 compromises with Senate Democrats and protect the President\u2019s right flank. Trump, surrounded by protesters outside the White House gates, was trolling them on Twitter and raging that Congress was not bending to his will.\n\nSome Republicans marveled that the focus for many leaders in the party was on shifting blame and scoring wins, not finding a way to reopen the government.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a lead negotiator in the immigration talks that are central to the crisis. \u201cThe idea of letting this continue to fester is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, remained unwilling to incorporate protections for the roughly 800,000 young people who were brought to the country illegally as children. Democrats have conditioned their votes to fund the government on protections for those young people, known as Dreamers. Trump last year ended temporary protections for those individuals and told Congress to pass a replacement.\n\nOn Saturday, top White House officials optimistically called it \u201ca tangential issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House position remains the same: we will not negotiate the status of 690,000 unlawful immigrants while hundreds of millions of tax-paying Americans \u2026 are held hostage by Senate Democrats,\u201d White House legislative director Marc Short told reporters on Saturday. \u201cWe hope Senate Democrats will yield.\u201d\n\nBut the rhetoric didn\u2019t invite compromise. \u201cIt\u2019s like a two-year-old\u2019s temper tantrum,\u201d Short said.\n\nThe White House budget director Mick Mulvaney insisted all talk of the funding lapse should be branded \u201cSchumer Shutdown,\u201d after Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cIt has that nice little ring to it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Mulvaney said, again arguing that talks with Schumer were fruitless. \u201cAt what point does it even become profitable to continue to work with someone like that?\u201d\n\nBut if Republicans hope to reopen the government, the White House will need to work with Schumer and his caucus, where retreat was not an appealing option as Day One of the shutdown unfolded. Schumer\u2019s top deputy, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, briefed House Democrats on Saturday morning behind closed doors. From outside, cheers were audible, signaling a compromise was unlikely.\n\n\u201cThe President created this challenge on September 5th,\u201d Durbin told TIME outside the Capitol in the early hours of Saturday morning as he prepared to make his way home after a long night. It was on Sept. 5 that Trump declared an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, that protected many of the Dreamers.\n\n\u201cThe Republican-controlled House and Senate have not produced a single bill to respond to this,\u201d an exhausted Durbin said. \u201cThe President put the fates of these young people in doubt, and we have a responsibility to do something to help them.\u201d\n\nThat call to action was echoed throughout the day as lawmakers marveled how a program Trump backed as late as last week suddenly was the sticking point.\n\n\u201cThe only way out of this is for the President to take \u2018yes\u2019 for an answer,\u201d said Schumer, who met with the President for 90 minutes over cheeseburgers late Friday afternoon. Schumer thought he was close to an off-ramp and indicated he could convince his colleagues to give the President some of the money needed for his border wall.\n\nFrantically, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell phoned the White House urging the President to stand firm against any deal shorter than four weeks and to void any hopes of compromise with Schumer. He also phoned House Speaker Paul Ryan and urged him to hold the line against compromise.\n\nAt the White House, advisers told the President that the Democrats\u2019 offer was only for one year of border building, not the whole costs. That, for the moment, talked him away from dealmaker and back toward his hardline stance.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly phoned Schumer on Friday to tell him that a short-term deal was not possible under these conditions.\n\n\u201cNegotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O,\u201d Schumer fumed from the Senate floor midday Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to that President? He backed off at the first sign of pressure,\u201d Schumer said, casting the President as a choke artist \u2014 a gamble that could provoke Trump.\n\nRepublicans continued to shove blame on the Democrats. They accused their colleagues across the aisle of placing politics above the health and well-being of American children, since the failed spending package contained funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which lapsed in September. They rejected the notion that their own party \u2014 which controls both chambers of Congress, and which has failed to bring CHIP to the floor in the four months since it lapsed \u2014 bore any responsibility.\n\n\u201cBottom line, this was a clean bill, and it\u2026 is so obvious that they are putting the Obama legacy ahead taking care of children and supporting our troops,\u201d Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins of West Virginia told TIME.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Capitol on Saturday, other House Republicans held their ground. Throughout this entire process \u2014 the tentative progress towards an immigration deal last week; the negotiations of a spending bill after that progress collapsed \u2014 these lawmakers had been the biggest hurdle to compromise. Unlike their more moderate colleagues in the Senate, a powerful faction of conservatives in the House is rigidly opposed to a bipartisan solution on DACA, preferring instead a hardline bill that would restrict immigration and amplify domestic enforcement.\n\nBut when asked if her colleagues would be amenable to an immigration compromise, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the fourth-ranking House Republican, demurred. \u201cThe first order of business is to get the government funded,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more time [on immigration] \u2014 and that should not be used to put the country through this shutdown.\u201d\n\nThere were whispers of disagreement among Republican leaders on the Hill. Reports indicated McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan were not on the same page; aides to each disputed those reports strongly.\n\nYet, there are limits to how much McConnell can unilaterally do. Spending bills have to start in the House, and it\u2019s not clear Republicans in both chambers were of the same mind, or where the President might be on a final compromise. Ryan has a rowdy caucus to manage, McConnell will need Democratic votes to reach the 60-vote threshold to fund the government, and the President has proven unpredictable.\n\nFor his part, McConnell sought a way out of the crisis that didn\u2019t hinge on the President\u2019s consistency. He offered a possible deal to reopen the government through Feb. 8 \u2014 or so \u2014 and fund a health insurance program for poor kids for six years in exchange for a pledge that talks will resume on an immigration deal that would protect Dreamers. The three-week funding bill is a one-week reduction from the proposal that failed late Friday, a difference that seemed to make no difference to Democrats, especially if promises from the President were in the mix.\n\n\u201cThis President just does not have a reputation for telling the truth,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California.\n\nAs the Democrats huddled to discuss their options, they looked up to see split-screen coverage of a stand-still Capitol and scores of women marching against Trump\u2019s agenda. Any skittishness about the decision to shutter government melted as they saw the grassroots activists filling streets from San Diego to New York. Republicans are worried they could lose their majorities in the House and maybe the Senate in this fall\u2019s elections, and maintaining this energy among liberal activists is crucial.\n\n\u201cAll I can tell you is there are a lot of meetings going on. I just came from one,\u201d Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent, told TIME on Saturday afternoon as he walked down a hallway in the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The building was quiet and seemingly empty. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d say I\u2019m optimistic, but I\u2019d say that everyone wants to get to a positive result.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, too, were clearly frustrated. Against long odds, Ryan had cobbled together enough votes for a one-month funding plan by promising the most conservatives lawmakers a vote on a hardline immigration plan that has little chance of clearing the House, let alone find support in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe do some crazy things in Washington but this is utter madness,\u201d the Speaker said, brimming with frustration. He later sent that observation to his email list.\n\nIt echoed McConnell\u2019s pre-shutdown pique. Even as the government was hurtling toward running out of cash, the top Republican in the Senate said he wasn\u2019t sure what it would take to get the the President\u2019s sign-off. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something that President Trump supports,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not yet indicated what measure he\u2019s willing to sign.\u201d\n\nIn fact, some in the President\u2019s negotiating team told lawmakers to pitch a Homeland Security outline of immigration demands. Hardliners inside the White House said the list was incomplete, and the President seemed to side with them. That effectively undercut Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a close Kelly ally, and sent everyone back into a chaos so familiar after a year of the Trump presidency.\n\nThat left many White House aides and their Republican counterparts on the brink of rage and undercutting each other in meetings. \u201cHow do we win against Congress if we can\u2019t even agree among ourselves? We can\u2019t even figure out what a win looks like,\u201d a frustrated White House staffer said. \u201cNo one here knows how this ends.\u201d", "title": "The People Who Started the Shutdown Don\u2019t Know How to End It", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5111513/shutdown-day-two-congress/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T02:48:30Z"}, {"textData": "Photo\n\nThe leader of the Hawaii National Guard told state lawmakers on Friday that he informed the governor that a panic-inducing missile alert was a false alarm two minutes after it had been sent to cellphones statewide.\n\nThe leader, Maj.

Many years, it has not passed any budget resolution at all. This is perhaps the most basic responsibility of the legislative branch, yet for decades, Congress has repeatedly come up short.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Senator Mitch McConnell promised that he would pass a budget every year if and when Republicans gained a Senate majority. But in 2016 there was no budget resolution at all, which led us to the unusual situation we saw last year, where there were two budget resolutions, one to set up the failed Republican health care bill and another, later in the year, to set up tax reform.\n\nThat Congress can fail to pass a budget with so little consequence \u2014 if anything, it boosted Republicans, by giving them two opportunities to try major partisan legislation \u2014 shows what a cynical charade the process has become. The eventual budget resolutions that were passed reveal how disconnected the process has become from actual budgetary considerations. The Republican resolution a year ago was what\u2019s known as a \u201cshell budget\u201d \u2014 essentially just a set of instructions that would have allowed the health care bill to be passed with a simple majority vote.\n\nThe health care bill, whatever its merits, was not a budget, or a central component of anyone\u2019s conception of what a budget should be. But that\u2019s what the budget resolution was used for. And that is, in many ways, the problem: The budget process is not really about budgeting anymore.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn other years, the budget process has become bogged down, and Congress has kept the government funded through temporary extensions known as continuing resolutions (C.R.s) that fund government operations based on current levels, or rolled everything into an omnibus \u2014 or in some cases, a \u201cCRomnibus,\u201d combining a budget omnibus bill and a continuing resolution. It\u2019s kludgy language to describe a kludgy process.\n\nThe reliance on an ad hoc system of budgeting has made it even more difficult for Congress to keep the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order. The continuing resolution passed by the House this week would have added about $30 billion to the national debt.\n\nThe stalemates that have come to define the budget process have helped set the stage for repeated shutdown showdowns. It is a broken process that has enabled and empowered partisan bad faith by setting up a situation in which everything is riding on a few enormous bills. So lawmakers try to hook other priorities \u2014 immigration, say, or health care \u2014 to \u201cmust pass\u201d legislation in hopes of using the leverage to push them through.\n\nFrom a purely tactical perspective, pursuing political objectives to the point of a shutdown is rarely an effective strategy. The last government shutdown, in 2013, grew out of Republican opposition to Obamacare, which at the time was an unpopular program. The shutdown started on the same day the health law\u2019s insurance exchanges opened, and crashed \u2014 but during the few weeks the government was closed, Obamacare actually grew more popular. I am highly sympathetic to the plight of the Dreamers who have become central to the current fight, but I would not be surprised if this shutdown goes for Democrats the way the last one did for Republicans.\n\nAs long as the current system remains in place, and partisan volatility remains high, these showdowns are likely to recur. There are, however, a variety of options for reform, ranging from small tweaks to total overhauls.\n\nJames Capretta of the American Enterprise Institute has proposed forcing the White House to be more involved in the process by making the budget resolution a law signed by the president, thus encouraging cross-branch negotiation. Another possibility raised by Molly Reynolds of the Brookings Institution would be to find ways to limit legislative attachments that are mostly meant to make the other party look bad. Moving to a two-year budget process might ease annual pressures. Or, per Yuval Levin, the editor of National Affairs, a ground-up reimagining of the process might be in order.\n\nReforms won\u2019t be easy under the best of circumstances. And the blame game now playing out in Washington shows that the shutdown itself has become a vehicle for partisan point scoring. The first step toward fixing the system is for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to decide that their priority is to fulfill essential governing responsibilities \u2014 and stop treating the shutdown as a game to be won.", "title": "Op-Ed Contributor: The Shutdown Shows the Twisted Rules of a Broken Congress", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/opinion/shutdown-broken-congress-budget.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T02:17:22Z"}, {"textData": "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 6.3 earthquake has struck northern Chile.\n\nThe quake, which was deep at 110 kilometers (68 miles), struck at 10:06 p.m. local time Saturday.

And this November, they\u2019ll be showing up to the polls. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to vote,\u201d says O\u2019Connell, who canvassed and phone banked for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 election, \u201ceven if I don\u2019t have a candidate I strongly believe in.\u201d (Taddeo, who will still be 17 in November, plans to convince her homebound grandmother to vote in her stead.)\n\nOne year after the Women\u2019s March became the largest single-day protest in U.S. history, O\u2019Connell and her friends represent the movement\u2019s new direction: Doing anything and everything to wrestle control of Congress from a Republican Party that has largely worked to advance President Trump\u2019s agenda. An unprecedented surge of Democratic women are running for office this year, but that\u2019s just the crest of the \u201cPink Wave.\u201d In interviews with some of those among the estimated 120,000 people who marched in New York City Saturday, a pattern emerged. If they\u2019re not running, they\u2019re organizing. If they\u2019re not organizing, they\u2019re donating. If they\u2019re not donating, they\u2019re voting. Nobody is doing nothing.\n\nThe official Women\u2019s March organizers have translated this motivation into a new strategy for 2018: Power to the Polls, a nationwide voter registration drive targeting first-timers in swing states ahead of the midterms. Marchers have created their own ways to expand their political impact, too.\n\n\u201cLast year we were all in shock, angry we didn\u2019t do more, says Diane Johnson, a 59-year old New York City real state broker. \u201cNow we know we can\u2019t let this ever happen again.\u201d Johnson says she is personally making sure everyone she knows is registered to vote. She\u2019s also making regular donations to Emily\u2019s List, which supports pro-choice Democratic women candidates.\n\nLisette Cheresson, a 33-year old festival organizer, said that after last year\u2019s march, she began attending local Democratic party meetings and learning the inner workings of New York local government. Her friend Erica Duncan, a 28-year old designer, joined the campaign to repeal New York City\u2019s \u201ccabaret law,\u201d which made it hard for local businesses to allow dancing in their establishments. Lauren Barkley, a 30-year old fashion student, said she has given money to so many different causes over the last year that sometimes after a night of drinking she\u2019ll wake up to an email thanking her for her contribution to Planned Parenthood or the ACLU \u2014 \u201cdrunk donating,\u201d she calls it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of this would have happened if Hillary had won,\u201d Cheresson says. \u201cWe would have continued to live under the assumption that we had broken the glass ceiling, when in fact we had only cracked it.\u201d She likens this possibility to the Obama presidency, \u201cwhen people thought racism was over, and really it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKim Hall, 45, says participating in last year\u2019s Women\u2019s March helped her meet other like-minded women in Wilton, CT. When they noticed that a local candidate for school board had posted confederate flags on Facebook and called on Trump to \u201cbuild a wall,\u201d they started a publicity campaign, organized against her, and got local organizations to pull their endorsements. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t inclusive, and it didn\u2019t belong on our school board,\u201d Hall says.\n\nIn many ways, this year\u2019s anniversary March was a celebration of everything the women\u2019s movement has done in the last year, from organizing calls to Congress to coalescing around the #MeToo campaign. And throughout the March, there was a sense of personal agency, a feeling that any one person could make a difference moving forward. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is an emphasis on the fact that women can make a change in the midterms,\u201d says Kathleen McNamara, a 64-year old grants writer carrying a sign showing a pink tidal wave. \u201cIt\u2019s a women\u2019s wave coming.\u201d", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s a Women\u2019s Wave Coming.\u2019 The Women\u2019s March Is Turning Into a True Political Force", "sourceId": "time", "sourceName": "Time", "url": "http://time.com/5111480/womens-march/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T01:53:09Z"}, {"textData": "Both 1-2, the Boston Uprising and San Francisco Shock are hungry for a win to get to .500. The Uprising and Shock are in the middle of the overall rankings, ranking eighth and ninth respectively. With reports of the San Francisco Shock having some issues with synergy and team communication, it\u2019ll be very interesting to see how San Francisco moves up from here.\n\nIf San Francisco wants to avoid being in the bottom three, they will have to do some serious reevaluating \u2013 their ultimate economy, compositions, and communication are all lacking and inefficient. With a star roster featuring Babybay, Dhak and Sleepy, the Shock should be pushing their way to the top. Perhaps when sinatraa comes of age, he can help in the field they\u2019re lacking in most: DPS.\n\nMap 1 : Dorado\n\nSan Francisco almost let the Boston Uprising take Dorado without contest. They attempted to spawn camp Boston in the beginning, but were quickly pushed back through the choke point. Surprisingly, Boston didn\u2019t punish them for this, and San Francisco was able to live to see a few more minutes. Boston took the first point like candy from a baby, but faced some resistance capturing point B.\n\nBoston took the second point with only 2:13 in the time bank, which lead to their unsuccessful completion on Dorado. Striker\u2019s Tracer came in and started to get eliminations on San Francisco, and exposed a lack of synergy on the Shock\u2019s ability to work together and make an effective hold. Dreamkazper used Deadeye to eliminate Babybay mid-Dragonblade, but somehow San Francisco woke up at the last possible second to hold Boston from taking the last point.\n\nOn Boston\u2019s defensive run, they started to show some fatigue. Babybay switched to Widowmaker and was able to charge his ultimate right before the first choke point. Babybay picked Boston off one-by-one through the first two points. Towards the end, it was looking grim for San Francisco, as they were forced to reset. The Shock\u2019s ability to properly utilize ultimates was nowhere to be found, as Sleepy popped his Transcendence off the payload, after getting pushed by Dreamkazper\u2019s Genji, and eventually eliminated by his Dragonblade.\n\nSan Francisco came in aggressively, forcing Boston into a reset, and completing the map, winning Dorado 2-3.\n\nMap 2 : Horizon Lunar Colony\n\nSan Francisco started on the defense for Horizon, and performed extremely poor. This may have been the quickest play on Horizon we have seen in the Overwatch League. Striker\u2019s Tracer was able to get a tick on point A completely unnoticed. Kalios pushed with his D.Va to get Boston off from getting the second tick, and they ended up having to reset.\n\nBoston came back to force San Francisco into a reset to take point A. Rushing point B in the blink of an eye, Striker came through completely uncontested again, getting two ticks. San Francisco couldn\u2019t get it together to keep Boston off, and Boston took round one, 2-0.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s offense was a mess. They attempted a quad-tank composition with Danteh on Roadhog, Nomy on Reinhardt, Nevix on D.Va and Babybay on Zarya. This did them no good, and Babybay quickly switched back to Widowmaker.\n\nSleepy switched to Sombra to catch Boston off-guard, but it was just too late to attempt the Sombra composition. With sixty seconds left, the Shock still had no ticks on the first point. Boston performed a full-hold on San Francisco, and took Horizon 2-0, tieing up the series 1-1.\n\nMap 3 : Oasis\n\nThe first round took us to Oasis City Center, where things did not look good for the Shock. Dhak\u2019s Mercy almost immediately got killed by a car, and Boston quickly took the first point. Boston went up to 99% on the point with ease, but San Francisco was able to make a comeback, taking control in overtime. In the 99-99 overtime, Danteh came in as Tracer and did an excellent job of zoning Boston off the point, taking the first round.\n\nThe second round took us to University, where Nevix went Roadhog, and Babybay switched to Junkrat. They were able to wipe the Uprising out at the start, and take control of the point quickly. At 75%, both tanks on the Shock were eliminated, and Boston took back control of the point at 83%. The Shock quickly regrouped to take control again, and fought Boston off in a 38-99 overtime. Babybay switched to McCree, pushing Boston off, and after a strong 99-99 overtime, San Francisco secured Oasis, 0-2, taking the series lead 1-2.\n\nMap 4 : Eichenwalde\n\nBabybay and Dreamkazper started off the Shock\u2019s defense round of Eichenwalde both running Pharahs. Dreamkazper proved to be the better Pharah, as he eliminated Babybay, Dhak, and Nevix pretty quickly into the round, taking the first point. San Francisco was forced into a reset, giving Boston the opportunity to quickly push the payload through the climb.\n\nBabybay went back to Pharah, taking the high ground to snipe Boston off. Gamsu used Primal Rage to push San Francisco off their contest, and they pushed through the second point. Nomy switched to Reinhardt, and Nevix to Zarya, but it didn\u2019t help, as Striker\u2019s Tracer was back at it again with the flank attack near the last point, allowing Boston to complete, 3-0.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s offensive run started poorly \u2013 with only two minutes left, they had no ticks on the first point. Their supports were eliminated, and Dreamkazper\u2019s Pharah came back with a vengeance, with Striker\u2019s Tracer helping down below. At the last possible second, San Francisco initiated an overtime, pushed Boston into a reset, and took the payload with 2:30 left to take the map.\n\nBabybay temporarily switched to Soldier 76, and ended up throwing his Tactical Visor away in the tunnel before the climb. After this terrible play, Babybay switched to Widowmaker, took the high ground, and had a lot of great kills, almost securing the second point. However, Neko came in with his Zenyatta and eliminated Babybay, winning the map 3-1, and tying the series 2-2.\n\nMap 5 : Lijiang Tower\n\nOn the first round of the tiebreaker map Lijang Tower, San Francisco didn\u2019t even show up. Danteh (Tracer), Nomy (Winston) and Nevix (D.Va) got picked off twice over. The Shock just couldn\u2019t get it together, and Boston took the first round 100-0.\n\nThe second round, which should have been the round to end it all, was an absolute embarrassment on Boston\u2019s part. After an aggressive push from San Francisco, Boston came back to flip the point in their favor at 77%. San Francisco took it back at 49%, and Boston flipped it yet again in a 50-99 overtime. Boston had the chance to take the point, but Gamsu\u2019s Reinhardt wasted a charge, ramming himself into the wall right and getting himself eliminated, giving San Francisco the win to tie it up 1-1.\n\nSan Francisco came into the final round with some visible rage and real hunger for the win. Babybay\u2019s Pharah controlled the skies, keeping Boston off the point. Somehow, at 99%, Boston pushed through and flipped the point back in their favor. When all was thought to be said and done, the Shock got it together and took the point back, securing them the 2-3 win.\n\nThe Shock may have gotten the series win, but if we want to talk about unconvincing victories, this was the absolute poster child.", "title": "Boston Uprising vs San Francisco Shock | Match Recap - Overwatch Wire", "sourceId": "usa-today", "sourceName": "USA Today", "url": "https://overwatchwire.usatoday.com/2018/01/20/boston-uprising-vs-san-francisco-shock-match-recap/", "publishDate": "2018-01-21T01:50:33Z"}, {"textData": "North Korean Hyon Song Wol, head of North Korea\u2019s art troupe, arrives at the Seoul Train Station in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, Jan. 21, 2018. The head of a hugely popular girl band arrived in South Korea on Sunday across the rivals\u2019 heavily fortified border to check preparations for a Northern art troupe she also leads during next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea. (Han Jong-chan/Yonhap via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The head of a hugely popular North Korean girl band crossed the heavily fortified border into South Korea on Sunday to check preparations for rare performances by an art troupe she also leads during next month\u2019s Winter Olympics.\n\nAppearing live on South Korean television, Hyon Song Wol didn\u2019t speak when she walked past a crowd of reporters, onlookers and a barrage of camera flashes before boarding an express train at Seoul\u2019s railway station for the eastern city of Gangneung, where her art troupe is to perform during the Pyeongchang Olympics.\n\nShe is the leader of Pyongyang\u2019s all-female Moranbong Band, which was hand-picked by leader Kim Jong Un. She\u2019s been the subject of intense South Korean media attention since she attended last week\u2019s talks at the border that struck an agreement on the 140-memer Samjiyon art troupe\u2019s two performances \u2014 one in Seoul and the other in Gangneung, where some of the games will take place. After the talks, North Korea said Hyon would also lead the Samjiyon art troupe, whose performances would be the first by a North Korean group in South Korea since 2002.\n\nWith no official media access given to Hyon, TV stations broadcast live footage of her bus moving on Seoul\u2019s roads before arriving at the railway station, where hundreds of police officers were mobilized to maintain order. Photos showed a smiling Hyon shaking heads with a South Korean official upon arrival at the border. Later Sunday, wearing a dark winter coat and fur scarf and with half her hair tied to the back, she looked more serious with an expressionless face.\n\nHyon\u2019s arrival came hours after the International Olympic Committee allowed 22 North Korean athletes to take part in the Olympics in exceptional entries given to the North. Among the 22 are 12 women who will join South Korea\u2019s female hockey team in the Koreas\u2019 first-ever unified Olympic team. The other sports events the North Koreans will compete in are figure skating, short track speed skating, Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe 22 North Korean athletes will march together with South Korean players under a single \u201cunification flag\u201d depicting their peninsula during the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang. \u201cSuch an agreement would have seemed impossible only a few weeks ago,\u201d IOC chief Thomas Bach said in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe current mood of reconciliation between the Koreas flared after Kim abruptly expressed his willingness to improve ties and send a delegation to the Olympics during his annual New Year\u2019s address. Outside critics dismissed Kim\u2019s overture as a tactic to use improved ties with Seoul to weaken U.S.-led international sanctions over North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear and missile programs.\n\nHyon, who is also an alternate member of the ruling party\u2019s Central Committee, is travelling with six other North Koreans. Her delegation had been expected in South Korea on Saturday, but North Korea canceled that plan on Friday night before it proposed a two-day trip starting Sunday. It wasn\u2019t clear why the visit was rescheduled.\n\nHyon\u2019s advance team is to inspect a venue for her art troupe\u2019s performance in Gangnenug later Sunday. The team is expected to stay overnight at Gangneung before returning to Seoul to check another venue in the capital on Monday, according to Yonhap news agency.\n\nThe Samjiyon art troupe, which comprises orchestra members, singers and dancers, is part of North Korea\u2019s Olympic delegation that also includes athletes, officials, journalists and a taekwondo demonstration team.\n\nNorth Korea on Sunday offered to send another advance team across the border on Thursday to look at accommodation facilities, a press center and the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies, according to Seoul\u2019s Unification Ministry. South Korea is to send its own advance team to North Korea on Tuesday to review logistics for a joint cultural event at the North\u2019s Diamond Mountain and their non-Olympic skiers\u2019 joint practices at the North\u2019s Masik ski resort, the ministry said.\n\nHyon was a popular singer before she was appointed to lead the Moranbong Band, which serves as the \u201csoft\u201d public face of the Kim government. Its members in short skirts and high heels or stylish military uniforms sing and dance odes to Kim. There is speculation that some of the Moranbong members may also appear in the Samjiyon art troupe, which observers say was likely hastily formed ahead of Olympics-related talks with South Korea.\n\nUnder a deal with South Korea, the Samjiyon group is to play folk songs and classic masterpieces that are well-known to both Koreas and fit in with the theme of unification. An attempt by the group to perform any propaganda piece would trigger protests from conservatives in South Korea. The Moranbong Band canceled its planned 2015 performance in Beijing at the last minutes after Beijing wanted to replace a missile launch scene from the background of the stage, according to South Korea media.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Coming off a riveting comeback against an evenly matched Philadelphia Fusion, the Gladiators proved that they could execute when the pressure was on. The question today was could they withstand the pressure of a top tier team with a god-like player?\n\nSadly, the answer to that question was a definitive \u201cno\u201d. The Gladiators were unable to win a map today against the juggernaut New York Excelsior, who convincingly took the series 0-4. While New York was occasionally challenged in spots, they never looked like they were outclassed or confused by anything Los Angeles threw at them. The Excelsior\u2019s DPS players habitually proved to be superior, and their defensive strategies were exceptionally sound, never allowing the Gladiators to complete a map.\n\nNew York walks away unscathed and undefeated, and we all now wait in anticipation for the matchup between the Excelsior and the Dynasty next week. Los Angeles drops to 2-2 on the season, and with the battle of LA looming vs. the Valiant, they will need to address some questionable defensive strategies before heading in.\n\nMap 1 : Dorado\n\nThe series began on Dorado, and in a surprise turn of events, New York would start Pine on Widowmaker for the first time on an Escort map. In response, the attacking LA Gladiators strategized to eliminate Pine first, and then focus their push on the payload. Their initial execution was sound, as Hydration on Pharah was patient with a flank and scored the first elimination on Pine. As planned, Los Angeles would then begin their push, but New York showed that even without Pine they could hold the choke point.\n\nWith the Gladiators focused on breaking through the choke, Pine would quickly return to the battle and start hitting his his shots. As the match wore on, Los Angeles continued to dedicate all their resources to eliminating Pine, and did not show decisiveness when attempting to push the payload. As they became scattered, Pine would pick the Gladiator\u2019s players off one by one and Libero\u2019s Junkrat, would never allow them to group effectively. Unable to put pressure on Pine and win a team fight, the Gladiators would only push the Payload a mere 73 meters as time ran out.\n\nWith a superb defense, New York was put in a position where they only needed to win a single team fight to be victorious. Playing a standard dive composition, New York was quickly able to focus in on Shaz\u2019s Zenyatta and then take down BigGoose\u2019s Mercy. Los Angeles was unable to recover, and New York easily pushed through the finish line. New York wins Dorado, 0-1.\n\nMap 2 : Horizon Lunar Colony\n\nOn Horizon Lunar Colony, the Gladiators picked themselves up and looked to rebound. Rather than forcibly displacing New York off the high ground, Los Angeles would hastily get to the point and force the Excelsior to relocate. As New York moved to contest, they became bottled up and were quickly eliminated leading to a straightforward capture of point A for Los Angeles.\n\nPoint B turned into a battle of attrition and saw both teams trading kills. Eventually, the Gladiators were able to wear the Excelsior down and capture two ticks. As time ticked away, an epic overtime battle commenced with both teams trading kills. Hydration with a last ditch effort was able to get two kills with a Rip-Tire from spawn, but it wouldn\u2019t be enough due to New York\u2019s timely cycling to players to contest the point. Los Angeles would end up amassing a 97% capture rate but were stopped short of taking point B.\n\nKnowing they needed to capture both points to achieve a victory, the Excelsior went to their trusty dive composition. Rather than posting up with a standard defense, the Gladiators chose to have Surefour on Sombra, looking to get team wipes with an EMP. The EMP would hit for Surefour, but it would be too late, as New York\u2019s dive was able to zone out Los Angeles and take point A with over six minutes left.\n\nWith a ton of time to attack, the Excelsior looked to their supports to carry them to victory. With their dive in full effect New York would rack up kills on point B, and Ark would be able to sustain them through the final fight. Looking like a resurrection machine, Ark was all over the map with his use of Mercy\u2019s Valkyrie allowing the Excelsior to outlast the Gladiators despite their shorter spawn. New York wins Horizon, 1-2.\n\nMap 3 : Oasis\n\nAlready up 0-2, New York looked to shut the door on this series by inserting Pine back into the lineup for Oasis. Playing McCree and Widowmaker on City Center, Pine would be effective enough but didn\u2019t quit look up to his previous play on Control. Los Angeles made a concerted effort to stay out of his sight-lines, but it would only take an elimination of Surefour by Pine to turn the match at the end. Moving into overtime, Pine was able to score a headshot on Surefour and BigGoose was forced to use his Valkyrie to bring his teammate back to the fight. Losing their support ultimate early, Los Angeles could not withstand New York\u2019s point blitz and lost a close round 99-100.\n\nGardens would show that it was not all about Pine, as we would get to see a showcase of excellent Pharah play from both teams. Early on, Hydration stoped multiple pushes from New York dead in their tracks with exceptional use of his Barrages. To combat this, it would be Libero taking on the challenge and playing Pharah for New York. Libero would come up with the clutch play to seal the victory for the Excelsior by eliminating Hydration in overtime. To punctuate his performance, he would then rack up three additional kills with a perfectly timed Barrage on the point giving New York the capture, the map victory, and the series win. New York wins Oasis, 0-2.\n\nMap 4 : Eichenwalde\n\nPlaying for both map points and personal pride, Los Angeles came out strong on Eichenwalde behind Surefour\u2019s Pharah. Dueling last map\u2019s hero Libero, Surefour would win the contest and capture point A for the Gladiators. Unfortunately, the capture would come in overtime, only leaving a sparse amount of time for Los Angeles to move through the payload phase. Unable to get key kills and disregarding the payload for far too long, Los Angeles found themselves bottled up at the midpoint of the map unable to break New York\u2019s defenses.\n\nAfter losing the duel on defense to Surefour\u2019s Pharah, Libero upped his performance on attack. In the opening moments of their push, Libero showed his Pharah superiority by eliminating Surefour with a direct rocket hit, and then taking out BigGoose immediately afterwards. Without their top DPS and Mercy, the Gladiators lost the point in less than a minute. New York would switch to a dive composition and JJoNak\u2019s Zenyatta would be the difference in the round. He picked off Asher, who pressed him in the backline, and enabled his teammates to rack up kills behind his Orb of Discord.

Schumer even said he offered Trump funding for his wall on Friday, but that the president declined the deal. \nBut calling Democrats \u201ccomplicit\u201d in murder fit in with the White House\u2019s messaging on the government shutdown, which happened when the Senate failed to pass a short-term government funding bill by the end of Friday. Most of the Senate Democratic caucus, plus four Republicans, voted against the bill, many of them saying they would not support funding without a fix for the 700,000 undocumented young people Trump put at risk of deportation by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \nWhile Trump and the White House have occasionally referred to those young people, often called Dreamers, in fairly sympathetic terms,\u00a0they\u2019re now characterizing them as \u201cunlawful immigrants\u201d whom Democrats insist on helping.\nIt\u2019s a return to form for Trump, who launched his campaign by claiming that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals across the border, has called for a U.S.-Mexico border wall and has highlighted crimes committed by people without legal status in the country. \nWhile some undocumented immigrants do commit crimes separate from immigration, numerous studies have disputed the idea that immigrants are bringing more crime into the country. \nTrump and his administration have also repeatedly attacked Democrats for their immigration stances.

In the Hollywood-inspired popular images of the 1950s, the great white hunter was a fearless Clark Gable or Stewart Granger, tall and deeply tanned, who brought down a charging rhino with a single shot while his arrogant client cowered behind him, and who later romanced the client\u2019s neglected wife after saving her from a snarling lion.\n\nThe reality was Mr. Selby: short and stocky, mild and self-effacing, a man who seemed to listen with his eyes. He had curly hair, a boyishly shy smile and a wife and two children. He catered to men used to giving orders, not taking them, but did it with tact, avoiding upbraiding a client needlessly and almost never finding it necessary to save anyone. Neither he nor any client was ever seriously injured on a safari, though there were some close calls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was not all shooting and campfire tales. A Selby safari required an army of bearers, cooks, skinners, porters, drivers and others; game licenses and financial transactions; transportation arrangements, from trucks and horses to planes and boats; and a complex coordination of supplies and equipment: guns and ammunition, food, water, tents, cots, radios, medicines, maps, clothing and a thousand other necessities.\n\nWithout cellphones or evacuation helicopters, Mr. Selby had to be the doctor, mechanic, chauffeur, gin-rummy-and-drinking partner and universal guide, knowledgeable about mountain ranges, grassy plains, rivers, jungles, hunting laws, migratory patterns, and the Bushmen, Masai, Samburu, Dinka and Zulu tribes. He spoke three dialects of Swahili. And he improvised; if there was no firewood, he burned wildebeest dung.\n\nHe was no Gregory Peck, but had an easygoing personality that made for good company in the bush. He coped with emergencies, pulling a client clear of a stampede or a vehicle from a bog, treating snakebites or tracking a wounded lion in a thicket \u2014 his most dangerous game. He was left-handed, but his favorite gun was a right-handed .416 Rigby, which can knock down an onrushing bull elephant or Cape buffalo in a thundering instant.\n\nSafaris changed dramatically in his time. In Kenya and Tanganyika in the late 1940s and \u201950s, he took parties hundreds of miles into trackless bush country by truck, pitched camps with comfortable though primitive amenities, drank gin by kerosene lamp, and pursued game by his own instincts. Safaris lasted two or three months. The showers were often cold, but the food was good and the game plentiful.\n\nIn his later years in Botswana, safaris went out for just a few weeks and focused as much, if not more, on photography as on hunting, although Mr. Selby preferred hunters. Photography buffs stayed in hotel-like lodges and went on day trips to scenic sites. More adventurous hunters and photographers were flown to rendezvous points and driven in Land Rovers to fixed camps elaborately equipped with electric power, refrigerators, flush toilets, hot showers, kitchens and dining facilities with silverware and table linen.\n\n\u201cAfrica itself has changed out of all recognition, both physically and politically, and the old-time self-contained safari would have no place to go in today\u2019s Africa,\u201d Mr. Selby wrote for Sports Afield in 2010, when satellite phones, computers and helicopters made life easy for the busy executive on safari.\n\n\u201cThere are hunters today,\u201d he added, \u201cwho would prefer to have experienced the sense of freedom of an old-time safari, as I am sure there were those who went on safari many years ago who would have preferred something along the lines of what is offered today. The two experiences are as different as night is from day; the only feature common to both is the name \u2026 that magical word, \u2018safari.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

After World War II, he worked for Mr. Percival, who recognized his potential as a hunter-guide, and in 1949 he joined East Africa\u2019s foremost safari outfitter, Ker & Downey, based in Nairobi. In 1956, after Mr. Ruark\u2019s book had made him famous, he formed his own safari company, Selby & Holmberg.\n\nIn 1953, he married Maria Elizabeth Clulow, known as Miki. They had two children, Mark and Gail. Mark died in 2017. Mr. Selby is survived by his wife, daughter and a number of grandchildren.\n\nIn 1962, after Kenyan independence and political upheavals dimmed prospects for safaris in East Africa, he accepted a partnership in his old company, which became Ker, Downey and Selby, and in 1963 moved as its trailblazer to Bechuanaland, a British protectorate that became independent Botswana in 1966. It was a hunter\u2019s \u2014 and a photographer\u2019s \u2014 paradise.\n\n\u201cWhat we found exceeded our wildest expectations \u2014 a land which the passage of time had passed by, where nature had remained unchanged in the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Selby said in an interview for this obituary. \u201cThe vast savannas were teeming with huge herds of elephant, buffalo, kudu, zebra, wildebeest and sable. Lions were everywhere, showing little fear of man.\u201d\n\nFor 30 years, Mr. Selby ran company operations in Botswana, and guided hunters and photographers into leased concessions covering thousands of square miles in the Okavango Delta in the north and the vast Kalahari Desert in the south, home of the click-talking Bushmen. He cut tracks and built airfields in the wilderness.\n\nIn 1970, he established Botswana\u2019s first lodge and camps for photographic safaris. He hired guides and a large support staff for what became a dominant safari business in Southern Africa. After Ker, Downey and Selby was bought by Safari South in 1978, he remained a director, and even after resigning in 1993 he continued to lead safaris privately until retiring in 2000.\n\nIn 2007, President Festus Mogae of Botswana awarded Mr. Selby the Presidential Certificate of Honor in recognition of his contributions to hunting and photographic tourism.", "title": "Harry Selby, Renowned Hunter and Safari Guide, Is Dead at 92", "sourceId": "the-new-york-times", "sourceName": "The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/obituaries/harry-selby-dead.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T23:46:47Z"}, {"textData": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is ordering an Ethics Committee investigation after the New York Times reports that U.S. Rep.

His college archrival Chris Mullin, now the head coach at St. John\u2019s, stood at the other end of the sideline, and Ewing, almost out of habit, was readying himself for a fight.\n\nThe Georgetown men\u2019s basketball coach found a willing participant in Marcus Derrickson, the junior forward Ewing had famously scolded this month during a game against DePaul for taking a one-legged, step-back jumper during a game. \u201cWhat kind of shot is that? . . . Do you work on that shot?\u201d Ewing interrogated during a timeout, a moment that was captured on a video that went viral.\n\nOn Saturday, Derrickson got his redemption. The forward scored a career-high 27 points, including 16 in 10 minutes of overtime, to lead the Hoyas to their first home conference win, 93-89 over the Red Storm.\n\nIt was the Hoyas\u2019 first victory in double overtime since a 79-78 win over Connecticut in 2013 and Ewing\u2019s second victory in as many coaching matchups this season against his college foil-turned-good friend. Ewing said the atmosphere \u2014 an announced crowd of 8,976 donned gray T-shirts that were draped over seats before the game \u2014 the energy and the effort of the players all reminded him of those battles he and Mullin shared in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, Chris and I were kind of joking around about it a little bit at half court while the game was going on,\u201d Ewing said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m out there sweating, he\u2019s out there sweating. It\u2019s like we\u2019re physically out there playing, but we\u2019re on the sideline coaching.\n\n\u201cIt was a great game for both fans, both schools, because both teams played their hearts out. Both teams gave all the effort and energy that they could. It was just unfortunate for them that we made the plays that we needed to make down the stretch to secure the win.\u201d\n\n[Svrluga: Could the door to March Madness close on DMV teams?]\n\nDerrickson shined after regulation, scoring all of Georgetown\u2019s 10 points in the first overtime.\n\nThe Hoyas (13-6, 3-5 Big East) trailed 78-73 with 24 seconds left in the first overtime when Derrickson made all of his free throws after being fouled while shooting a three-pointer. After Shamorie Ponds made 1 of 2 free throws, Derrickson hit a three-pointer \u2014 his only make out of six attempts from beyond the arc \u2014 with four seconds left to force the second overtime.\n\nThere, a jumper from Derrickson helped Georgetown build a five-point lead with about 1\u00bd minutes left, and a jumper from sophomore guard Jagan Mosely made it seven as a shorthanded St. John\u2019s (10-10, 0-8) withered with two starters having fouled out. Mosely sealed the victory with a pair of free throws with two seconds left.\n\nDerrickson slumped his head back when it finally ended, relieved to have gotten such a win after an overtime loss to Syracuse in December and a double-overtime loss to Butler in Georgetown\u2019s Big East opener. In addition to his 27 points on 9-for-23 shooting, the Bowie native led all players with 11 rebounds.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t tough at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were using the Syracuse and the Butler game as motivation; we don\u2019t want to have another outcome like that.\u201d\n\nDerrickson, who was limited to 15 minutes by Ewing in a blowout loss to Creighton on Jan. 6 \u2014 the game after he was scolded for his shot selection \u2014 played a season-high 47 minutes Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe was big for us the whole game,\u201d Ewing said. \u201cShoot, I mean, a big three, big rebounds, big game. . . . Those are big minutes, 47 minutes. I told him, both he and Jessie [Govan], this is not the time to be tired. This is winning time. You\u2019ve got to suck it up and play.\u201d\n\nGovan had 16 points on 5-for-14 shooting and eight rebounds but found himself in foul trouble early and played just six minutes in the first half. A pair of freshmen stepped up in his place: Forward Jamorko Pickett finished with a career-high 16 points, including four three-pointers, and added nine rebounds and four turnovers. Guard Jahvon Blair scored 15 points, including four three-pointers, off the bench.\n\nBlair\u2019s only turnover of the night came with 49 seconds left in regulation and ultimately allowed St. John\u2019s to pull within one point. But overall, Ewing viewed the level of play from his freshmen as a step forward for Georgetown.\n\n\u201cI thought that today, those guys finally showed that they\u2019re not freshmen anymore,\u201d Ewing said. \u201cThey did everything for us both offensively and defensively. . . . They still managed some mistakes, but I thought for the most part they did a lot of things for us.\u201d\n\nHe praised Pickett in particular for starting to see himself as more than a three-point shooter and said: \u201cHe\u2019s finally starting to believe in himself. That\u2019s the Jamorko Pickett I recruited.\u201d\n\nThe win was a balm to Georgetown after consecutive tough defeats against the league\u2019s upper tier, including a 32-point loss to No. 1 Villanova on Tuesday.\n\nSt. John\u2019s, meanwhile, remains the only winless team in Big East play.\n\nThe Red Storm has suffered several tough defeats this season, losing to the top four teams in the league \u2014 Villanova, Xavier, Creighton and Seton Hall \u2014 by a combined 25 points.

From high-profile firings to contentious remarks, here's a look back at the ups and downs of his first year. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nThousands of women across the country marked the anniversary of President Trump\u2019s inauguration at rallies, marches and protests to remind the administration that many women still believe that his vision of a great America does not include them.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who is often discussed as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, told the crowd, \u201cIt is women who are holding our democracy together in these dangerous times.\u201d\n\nAnd Emily Patton, a spokeswoman for the march, told The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cThis year, we really want to show support for women who are running for office and to encourage more women, women of color and those in the LGBT community, to run for office, to register to vote, to be more civically engaged.\u201d\n\nBut while Trump is still struggling to win women \u2014 a demographic won by his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 recent approval polls show that men seem to be increasingly on the Trump train.\n\nMost men \u2014 52 percent \u2014 voted for Trump in the presidential election, according to exit polls. Some found his \u201cstrong man\u201d image attractive and supported him pushing back against what his supporters call \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d in a cultural climate that is becoming increasingly vocal about the impact of patriarchy.\n\nAs critics of Trump continue to vocalize their belief that his policies disadvantage women, some men\u2019s support of him grows.\n\nA recent CNN poll revealed that Trump\u2019s approval rating among men had improved eight points. Nearly half \u2014 49 percent \u2014 of American men approve of the job Trump is doing.\n\nAnd in a cumulative analysis of more than 600,000 SurveyMonkey interviews about Trump\u2019s job performance, some of Trump\u2019s better numbers are with men.\n\nNearly half \u2014 49 percent \u2014 of white millennial men without a college degree approve of the president\u2019s performance. And Trump\u2019s support has risen among blue-collar white men over 35.\n\nAnd even among some subgroups where Trump is doing poorly, like black Americans, Trump receives higher approval marks from men. According to the Atlantic:\n\n\u201cAmong African Americans and Hispanics, reactions to Trump depend more on gender than age or education. In every age group, and at every level of education, about twice as many African American men as women gave Trump positive marks. In all, 23 percent of black men approved of Trump\u2019s performance versus 11 percent of black women . . . Black men are one of the few groups for which Trump\u2019s 2017 average approval rating significantly exceeds his 2016 vote share.\n\nAmong Hispanics, men were also much more likely than women to express positive views about Trump. Among Hispanic men older than 50, Trump\u2019s approval \u2014 strikingly \u2014 exceeded 40 percent.\u201d\n\nConservative commentator Charlie Sykes told the Fix that quite a few men feel as if Trump is speaking for their concerns in a world where few are.\n\n\u201cA lot of blue collar men think they are living in an increasingly feminized world and Donald Trump represents to them unabashed, unapologetic masculinity \u2014 an in-your-face refusal to give in to political correctness or the politics of \u2018sensitivity.\u2019 They think he fights for them, as opposing to judging or preaching at them. And he makes the right enemies \u2014 football players who won\u2019t kneel, black female congresswomen, Hollywood elites, and the media.\n\nThey may not fully embrace his vulgarity, his insults or his brutishness, but they like the attitude. And, increasingly politics is not about issues or policies as much as it is about striking the right attitude.\u201d\n\nAuthor Michael Arceneaux is a frequent Trump critic who often writes about gender. He told the Fix that these numbers aren\u2019t that surprising.\n\n\u201cI regret that men collectively choose to be so embarrassing, but given how ingrained misogyny is in our society, I guess I cannot be totally surprised that a sexist, chauvinistic loudmouth manages to maintain high approval rating amongst men. Despite all signs to the contrary, Trump projects strength because men are trained to believe the sort of bravado and machismo Trump often projects is a sign of strength and leadership. It is, as he would put it, sad!\u201d\n\nBut while Trump may be experiencing some encouraging numbers with men, his team may have to ask themselves if it is worth losing women. Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel recently presented the White House staff with a memo showing how poorly the party is doing with women voters.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that politicians want to appeal to their bases. In the world of politics, there\u2019s a belief that it\u2019s best to dance with the one who brought you as the old saying goes. And it is men who helped get Trump to the White House.\n\nBut in a country that is increasingly looking to its political leaders to be a part of the fight for the respect of women, relying on a voting bloc that jumped on the Trump train in part because of its traditional views of gender could see that train forced to leave Washington. Women are energized in ways that they weren\u2019t in 2016 and that does not appear to be changing anytime soon.", "title": "As women march a year after Trump\u2019s election, his approval with some men grows", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/20/as-women-march-a-year-after-trumps-election-his-approval-with-some-men-grows/", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T23:04:45Z"}, {"textData": "From left, House Speaker Rep.

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) listen as President Trump speaks during a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony on Jan. 17. The latest federal shutdown reveals a deeply polarized political climate. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThough federal shutdowns have become a depressingly familiar ritual of American politics, the current one was born of a newer, more toxic dynamic \u2014 one in which the old partisan arguments about the size and role of government have been supplanted by a tribal battle over what it means to be an American.\n\nThe tactics are the same, and in some ways the culmination of a no-compromise, winner-take-all approach that has been taking root since at least as far back as the rise of the tea party movement. A deeply polarized political climate demands both sides play to their most ideological and rigid partisans.\n\nSo the conditions were there for yet another shutdown. But the match that ignited the kindling was a single comment: President Trump\u2019s racially charged suggestion that \u201cshithole countries\u201d such as Haiti and those from Africa produce undesirable immigrants.\n\nThe remark offered a vivid illustration of how a standoff ostensibly focused on spending had morphed into a different kind of battle. That conflict now pits the nativist impulses unleashed by Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and now embraced by his party at large, against the demands of a Democratic base that more reflects and embraces an increasingly diverse nation.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake in the immigration fight is a clash between two visions of our future \u2014 or if you want to be literal about it, a clash between our future and our past,\u201d said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Clinton Administration. \u201cBoth sides have pushed a large pile of chips on the table.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have insisted their leaders dig in on extending an Obama-era program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), offering protection against deportation to an estimated 800,000 immigrants brought to this country illegally as young children. The president demanded funding for his proposed border wall and other security measures.\n\nThe political ramifications are not entirely obvious, notwithstanding the hashtag war branding the impasse either the #schumershutdown, laying responsibility on Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), or the #trumpshutdown.\n\nWho gets the blame \u2014 or if voters will even care about the shutdown by the time Election Day rolls around \u2014 remains to be seen. Much will depend on how long it lasts and whether it damages the economy.\n\nWhile polls show large majorities are sympathetic to the plight of the young undocumented immigrants, most also say keeping the government open is a higher priority. The wall, on the other hand, is largely unpopular outside Trump\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost certainly a partisan filter for how people perceive this,\u201d said Steven Law, who heads the Senate Leadership Fund, a well-funded super PAC tied to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u201cAt worst, from my perspective, it will end up being a wash. This won\u2019t be like past shutdowns.\u201d\n\nShutdowns for a generation have been fought around the traditional partisan divides over federal spending and the government\u2019s role in American life. Most notable among them have been the ones in 1995 and 1996, and in 2013.\n\nThe balance of power was very different in those years. Both of the earlier shutdowns came at a time of divided government, with Democrats controlling the White House, and Republicans running Congress. And both turned out poorly for the Republicans.\n\nThe current deadlock is happening as \u2014 and because \u2014 the two parties are in the process of reorienting themselves in ways their top strategists once warned against.\n\nThat in turn reflects the shifting attitudes among their voters. When the Pew Research Center asked Americans in 1994 if \u201cimmigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents\u201d there was almost no partisan difference in the responses \u2014 32 percent of Democratic-leaning voters and 30 percent of Republican-leaning voters answered yes.\n\nBut that same question reveals an enormous political divide. In the summer of 2017, 84 percent on the Democratic side agreed that immigrants were a strength, compared with 42 percent on the Republican side \u2014 a gap of 42 points.\n\nAs recently as a decade ago, Democrats were leery of looking too permissive on immigration, and anxious to avoid election-year attacks over giving government benefits to the undocumented.\n\nThe Democratic stance on immigration is now defined from the increasingly impatient left. Protesters who support a path to citizenship have in recent years made their mark by disrupting events by leaders like President Barack Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cIt is a remarkable shift to see Democrats are leaning into the issue,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the leader of America\u2019s Voice, a liberal organization that supports a path to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThe Democratic Party is seeing people of color as full and equal parts of the coalition rather than communities that are more important come election time and less important when it comes to legislation.\u201d\n\nConservative activists have also been cheered by the dramatic shift in Republican focus, which has followed the White House\u2019s embrace of nativist language that casts the standoff as a choice between government funding for \u201clawful citizens\u201d and the \u201creckless demands\u201d of \u201cunlawful immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven two or three years ago, you couldn\u2019t have gotten away with being hard line on immigration,\u201d said Ed Martin, a former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party who now runs Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, a group that advocates for immigration restrictions. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the position that was palatable to the Republican donor class and the establishment.\u201d\n\nBut Trump proved in the 2016 election that immigration unified the GOP much more effectively than did its traditional focus on reducing entitlement spending, free trade and low deficits. Among the GOP base, the populist issues of trade and immigration are now far more animating than even abortion or taxes, Martin said.\n\n\u201cFor the Republicans that\u2019s helpful, because I have never thought that the populist movement would be able to understand the tax cuts as well as immigration,\u201d he said.\n\nRick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, agrees that immigration has become a front-burner question for the Republican base, and will likely prove decisive in GOP turnout this November.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump signs a DACA deal, caves on this thing, on the one-year anniversary of his presidency, it ends his presidency for all intents and purposes,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThere is no reason for the blue collar Democrats who voted for Trump last time to come out again.\u201d\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who led his party into the 1995 and 1996 shutdown over government spending, says Republicans have set up this confrontation as a midterm winner. The GOP will cast the Democrats as more focused on identity politics than the national interests, like funding the military, Gingrich predicted.\n\n\u201cThis is a decision by the Democrats that their future absolutely requires them to polarize the Latino vote,\u201d he added.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are betting it will be the Republicans who find themselves estranged and isolated.\n\n\u201cThey are living through a Trumpian period of ethnic nationalism and populism,\u201d Sharry said. \u201cThat clearly works for a majority of their party. But the majority of the country is much more in line with where the Democrats are.\u201d\n\nmichael.scherer@washpost.com", "title": "Shutdown: A familiar partisan ritual takes on new meaning in the Trump era - Washington Post", "sourceId": "the-washington-post", "sourceName": "The Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/shutdown-a-familiar-partisan-ritual-takes-on-new-meaning-in-the-trump-era/2018/01/20/d9952b12-fdf8-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html", "publishDate": "2018-01-20T22:54:36Z"}, {"textData": "Photo\n\nCAIRO \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence and the Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi pledged a united front against terrorism in the Middle East as Mr. Pence, the highest-level American official to visit the United States ally in nearly a decade, began a trip through the region after leaving behind a government shutdown in Washington.\n\nThe meetings focused on security cooperation and economic ties between the two countries as well as efforts to fight the Islamic State.

Temperatures will remain on the mild side, with lows in the mid 30s and a light west/southwest wind.\n\nView the current weather conditions at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Sunday): The cloud cover will be hard to break Sunday, as a weak surface level boundary injects low-level moisture into the region. We aren\u2019t talking about any rain, just lots of gray, low-level clouds for the duration of the day. So temperatures will be cooler than today, with afternoon highs in the low 50s. Mostly cloudy overnight Sunday with mild temperatures and perhaps a few foggy spots as well. Lows about 40 with a continued light south wind.\n\nSee Ian Livingston\u2019s forecast through the week.

The European ensemble depicts a warm high pressure ridge locked in place over the East Coast through the end of January.\n\nCertainly not within the next 10 to 14 days. After a mild weekend, two storms will develop next week and pass well to our west, which is a perfect recipe for rain in the Washington region. Beyond that, high pressure will actually build in with more intensity next weekend, which means more above-average temperatures for the final weekend of January.\n\nSo will we get another shot at some winter weather this season? And if so, when? For now, the second week of February looks as if it could get interesting around these parts. Long-range forecasts are far from perfect, but if we want another shot at a snowstorm setup, then we need to start rooting for more upper level air patterns like the one depicted below.\n\nNot a bad look to the pattern looking out 2 weeks via the ECMWF EPS.

But their claims to Appalachia fly in the face of centuries of resistance to white supremacy and settler colonialism that are woven into these hills and rivers. From indigenous resistance to militant maroon communities, to multiracial labor strikes and prisoner uprisings, to the very existence of tight-knit black and brown communities across these hills, we know Appalachia has never been and will never be their all-white vision- as long as we continue to resist.

Over the last year, white supremacists \u2014 emboldened by Trump\u2019s ascendance to the White House \u2014 have engaged in violence at multiple rallies across America, most infamously in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing anti-racist activist Heather Heyer.\u00a0\nHeimbach was an organizer of a large \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d rally in Tennessee in October. He and some 200 neo-Nazis, white nationalists, Klansmen and other assorted racists and fascists marched through the town of Shelbyville, where they were met by a significantly larger group of counter-protesters.\u00a0\nCan't really hear speech by prominent white supremacist Matthew Heimbach.
